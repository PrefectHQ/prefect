    Merges conditional branches back together.

    A conditional branch in a flow results in one or more tasks proceeding and one or
    more tasks skipping. It is often convenient to merge those branches back into a
    single result. This function is a simple way to achieve that goal.

    The merge will return the first real result it encounters, or `None`. If multiple
    tasks might return a result, group them with a list.

    Example:
        ```python
        with Flow("My Flow"):
            true_branch = ActionIfTrue()
            false_branch = ActionIfFalse()
