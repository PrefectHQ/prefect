class CloudFlowRunner(FlowRunner):
    """
    FlowRunners handle the execution of Flows and determine the State of a Flow
    before, during and after the Flow is run.

    In particular, through the FlowRunner you can specify which tasks should be
    the first tasks to run, which tasks should be returned after the Flow is finished,
    and what states each task should be initialized with.

    Args:
        - flow (Flow): the `Flow` to be run
        - state_handlers (Iterable[Callable], optional): A list of state change handlers
            that will be called whenever the flow changes state, providing an
            opportunity to inspect or modify the new state. The handler
            will be passed the flow runner instance, the old (prior) state, and the new
            (current) state, with the following signature:

            ```
                state_handler(
                    flow_runner: FlowRunner,
                    old_state: State,
                    new_state: State) -> State
            ```

            If multiple functions are passed, then the `new_state` argument will be the
            result of the previous handler.

    Note: new FlowRunners are initialized within the call to `Flow.run()` and in general,
    this is the endpoint through which FlowRunners will be interacted with most frequently.

    Example:
    ```python
    @task
    def say_hello():
        print('hello')

    with Flow("My Flow") as f:
        say_hello()

    fr = FlowRunner(flow=f)
    flow_state = fr.run()
    ```
