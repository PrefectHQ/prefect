            retrieving and storing state results during execution
        - state_handlers (Iterable[Callable], optional): A list of state change handlers
            that will be called whenever the task changes state, providing an
            opportunity to inspect or modify the new state. The handler
            will be passed the task runner instance, the old (prior) state, and the new
            (current) state, with the following signature:
