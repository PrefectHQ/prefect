"""
State is the main currency in the Prefect platform. It is used to represent the current
status of a flow or task.

This module contains all Prefect state classes, all ultimately inheriting from the base State
class as follows:

![diagram of state inheritances](/state_inheritance_diagram.svg){.viz-padded}

Every run is initialized with the `Pending` state, meaning that it is waiting for
execution. During execution a run will enter a `Running` state. Finally, runs become `Finished`.

    Base state class implementing the basic helper methods for checking state.

    another_state = Retrying()
    another_state.is_pending() # returns True
