    """A context manager that acquires and releases concurrency slots from the
    given concurrency limits.

    Args:
        names: The names of the concurrency limits to acquire slots from.
        task_run_id: The name of the task_run_id that is incrementing the slots.
        timeout_seconds: The number of seconds to wait for the slots to be acquired before
            raising a `TimeoutError`. A timeout of `None` will wait indefinitely.

    Raises:
        TimeoutError: If the slots are not acquired within the given timeout.

    Example:
    A simple example of using the async `concurrency` context manager:
    ```python
    from prefect.concurrency.v1.asyncio import concurrency

    async def resource_heavy():
        async with concurrency("test", task_run_id):
            print("Resource heavy task")
