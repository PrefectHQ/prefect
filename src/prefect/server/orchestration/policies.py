"""
Policies are collections of orchestration rules and transforms.

Prefect implements (most) orchestration with logic that governs a Prefect flow or task
changing state. Policies organize of orchestration logic both to provide an ordering
mechanism as well as provide observability into the orchestration process.

While Prefect's [orchestration rules][prefect.server.orchestration.rules.BaseOrchestrationRule]
can gracefully run independently of one another, ordering can still have an impact on
the observed behavior of the system. For example, it makes no sense to secure a
concurrency slot for a run if a cached state exists. Furthermore, policies, provide a
mechanism to configure and observe exactly what logic will fire against a transition.
