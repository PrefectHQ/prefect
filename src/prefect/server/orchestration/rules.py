"""
Prefect's flow and task-run orchestration machinery.

This module contains all the core concepts necessary to implement Prefect's state
orchestration engine. These states correspond to intuitive descriptions of all the
points that a Prefect flow or task can observe executing user code and intervene, if
necessary. A detailed description of states can be found in our concept
[documentation](/concepts/states).

Prefect's orchestration engine operates under the assumption that no governed user code
will execute without first requesting Prefect REST API validate a change in state and record
metadata about the run. With all attempts to run user code being checked against a
Prefect instance, the Prefect REST API database becomes the unambiguous source of truth for managing
the execution of complex interacting workflows. Orchestration rules can be implemented
as discrete units of logic that operate against each state transition and can be fully
observable, extensible, and customizable -- all without needing to store or parse a
single line of user code.

class BaseOrchestrationRule(contextlib.AbstractAsyncContextManager):
    """
    An abstract base class used to implement a discrete piece of orchestration logic.

    An `OrchestrationRule` is a stateful context manager that directly governs a state
    transition. Complex orchestration is achieved by nesting multiple rules.
    Each rule runs against an `OrchestrationContext` that contains the transition
    details; this context is then passed to subsequent rules. The context can be
    modified by hooks that fire before and after a new state is validated and committed
    to the database. These hooks will fire as long as the state transition is
    considered "valid" and govern a transition by either modifying the proposed state
    before it is validated or by producing a side-effect.

    A state transition occurs whenever a flow- or task- run changes state, prompting
    Prefect REST API to decide whether or not this transition can proceed. The current state of
    the run is referred to as the "initial state", and the state a run is
    attempting to transition into is the "proposed state". Together, the initial state
    transitioning into the proposed state is the intended transition that is governed
    by these orchestration rules. After using rules to enter a runtime context, the
    `OrchestrationContext` will contain a proposed state that has been governed by
    each rule, and at that point can validate the proposed state and commit it to
    the database. The validated state will be set on the context as
    `context.validated_state`, and rules will call the `self.after_transition` hook
    upon exiting the managed context.

    Examples:

        Create a rule:

        >>> class BasicRule(BaseOrchestrationRule):
        >>>     # allowed initial state types
        >>>     FROM_STATES = [StateType.RUNNING]
        >>>     # allowed proposed state types
        >>>     TO_STATES = [StateType.COMPLETED, StateType.FAILED]
        >>>
        >>>     async def before_transition(initial_state, proposed_state, ctx):
        >>>         # side effects and proposed state mutation can happen here
        >>>         ...
        >>>
        >>>     async def after_transition(initial_state, validated_state, ctx):
        >>>         # operations on states that have been validated can happen here
        >>>         ...
