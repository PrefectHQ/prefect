    #
    # This triggering algorithm maintains an invariant that there is exactly one
    # time-based "bucket" open and collecting events for each automation at a time. When
    # an event comes in that matches the automation, one of three things can happen:
    #
    # 1. The event would have matched an older bucket that has either expired or has
    #    already filled up, and thus is no longer relevant;
    # 2. The event matches the current bucket, but the bucket does not meet it's
    #    threshold yet;
    # 3. The event matches the current bucket, causes it to meet the the threshold, so
    #    we act immediately and advance the bucket to the next time period.
    #
    # Automations are also evaluated proactively without an event to see if they have
    # met their proactive threshold (where not enough events have happened in the time
    # period)
