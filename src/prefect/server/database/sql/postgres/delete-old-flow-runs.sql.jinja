-- Deletes old flow runs before the cutoff date.
--
-- Because flow runs cascade delete child task runs, the idea is to limit the amount of tasks deleted by this query.
-- If the query limited the amount of flow runs deleted, this could potentially delete an unbounded amount of task runs.
-- Therefore, the query joins flow runs to their children tasks, sorts by the flow run id, and takes children task runs
-- up to the limit, and only then takes the distinct flow run ids for deletion. For example, a limit of 1000 may only
-- delete 500 flow runs if there are 2 children task runs per flow run, but it will delete 1000 task runs for a total
-- of 1500 records.
--
-- Features:
-- - CTE with FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED for concurrent worker safety
-- - DELETE...USING for efficient JOIN (faster than WHERE IN)
-- - Returns deleted flow run count and cascade deleted task run count
--
-- Parameters:
--   :before - Delete flow runs before this timestamp
--   :limit - Maximum number of flow runs to delete in this batch
