        Accepts the standard Pydantic `model_dump` arguments, except for `mode` (which

        Usage docs: https://docs.pydantic.dev/2.6/concepts/serialization/#modelmodel_dump

        Args:
            include: A list of fields to include in the output.
            exclude: A list of fields to exclude from the output.
            by_alias: Whether to use the field's alias in the dictionary key if defined.
            exclude_unset: Whether to exclude fields that have not been explicitly set.
            exclude_defaults: Whether to exclude fields that are set to their default
                value.
            exclude_none: Whether to exclude fields that have a value of `None`.
