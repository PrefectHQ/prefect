class GCS(Storage):
    """
    GoogleCloudStorage storage class.  This class represents the Storage interface for Flows
    stored as bytes in an GCS bucket.  To authenticate with Google Cloud, you need to ensure
    that your Prefect Agent has the proper credentials available (see
    https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/production for all the authentication
    options).

    This storage class optionally takes a `key` which will be the name of the Flow object
    when stored in GCS. If this key is not provided the Flow upload name will take the form
    `slugified-flow-name/slugified-current-timestamp`.

    Args:
        - bucket (str, optional): the name of the GCS Bucket to store the Flow
        - key (str, optional): a unique key to use for uploading this Flow to GCS. This
            is only useful when storing a single Flow using this storage object.
        - project (str, optional): the google project where any GCS API requests are billed to;
            if not provided, the project will be inferred from your Google Cloud credentials.
        - stored_as_script (bool, optional): boolean for specifying if the flow has been stored
            as a `.py` file. Defaults to `False`
        - local_script_path (str, optional): the path to a local script to upload when `stored_as_script`
            is set to `True`. If not set then the value of `local_script_path` from `prefect.context` is
            used. If neither are set then script will not be uploaded and users should manually place the
            script file in the desired `key` location in a GCS bucket.
