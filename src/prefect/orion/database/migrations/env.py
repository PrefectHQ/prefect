            sqlalchemy.schema.ForeignKeyConstraint object.
        name: the name of the object. This is typically available via object.name.
        type: a string describing the type of object; currently "table", "column",
            "index", "unique_constraint", or "foreign_key_constraint"
        reflected: True if the given object was produced based on table reflection,
