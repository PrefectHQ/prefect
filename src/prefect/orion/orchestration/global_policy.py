"""
Bookkeeping logic that fires on every state transition.

For clarity, `GlobalFlowpolicy` and `GlobalTaskPolicy` contain all transition logic
implemented using [`BaseUniversalTransform`][prefect.orion.orchestration.rules.BaseUniversalTransform].
None of these operations modify state, and regardless of what orchestration Orion might
enforce on a transtition, the global policies contain Orion's necessary bookkeeping.
Because these transforms record information about the validated state committed to the
state database, they should be the most deeply nested contexts in orchestration loop.
