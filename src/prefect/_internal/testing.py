    """
    Async generator that retries a block of assertions until it succeeds or max attempts is reached.

    Useful for testing eventual consistency scenarios where changes may not
    propagate immediately.

    Args:
        max_attempts: Maximum number of attempts before raising the exception.
        delay: Time in seconds to wait between retry attempts.

    Yields:
        A context manager that captures exceptions during each attempt.

    Raises:
        The last exception raised within the block if all attempts fail.

    Example:
        ```python
        async for attempt in retry_assert(max_attempts=3):
            with attempt:
                for deployment in deployments:
                    await session.refresh(deployment)
                    assert deployment.status == DeploymentStatus.READY
        ```
