class IntervalSchedule(Schedule):
    """
    A schedule formed by adding `timedelta` increments to a start_date.

    IntervalSchedules only support intervals of one minute or greater.

    NOTE: If the `IntervalSchedule` start time is provided with a DST-observing timezone,
    then the schedule will adjust itself appropriately. Intervals greater than 24
    hours will follow DST conventions, while intervals of less than 24 hours will
    follow UTC intervals. For example, an hourly schedule will fire every UTC hour,
    even across DST boundaries. When clocks are set back, this will result in two
    runs that *appear* to both be scheduled for 1am local time, even though they are
    an hour apart in UTC time. For longer intervals, like a daily schedule, the
    interval schedule will adjust for DST boundaries so that the clock-hour remains
    constant. This means that a daily schedule that always fires at 9am will observe
    DST and continue to fire at 9am in the local time zone.

    Note that this behavior is different from the `CronSchedule`.
