    """
    A context manager that calls startup/shutdown hooks for the given application.

    Lifespan contexts are cached per application to avoid calling the lifespan hooks
    more than once if the context is entered in nested code. A no-op context will be
    returned if the context for the given application is already being managed.

    This manager is robust to concurrent access within the event loop. For example,
    if you have concurrent contexts for the same application, it is guaranteed that
    startup hooks will be called before their context starts and shutdown hooks will
    only be called after their context exits.

    A reference count is used to support nested use of clients without running
    lifespan hooks excessively. The first client context entered will create and enter
    a lifespan context. Each subsequent client will increment a reference count but will
    not create a new lifespan context. When each client context exits, the reference
    count is decremented. When the last client context exits, the lifespan will be
    closed.

    In simple nested cases, the first client context will be the one to exit the
    lifespan. However, if client contexts are entered concurrently they may not exit
    in a consistent order. If the first client context was responsible for closing
    the lifespan, it would have to wait until all other client contexts to exit to
    avoid firing shutdown hooks while the application is in use. Waiting for the other
    clients to exit can introduce deadlocks, so, instead, the first client will exit
    without closing the lifespan context and reference counts will be used to ensure
    the lifespan is closed once all of the clients are done.
