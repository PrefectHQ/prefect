class RemoteDaskEnvironment(RemoteEnvironment):
    """
    RemoteDaskEnvironment is an environment which takes the address of an existing
    Dask cluster and runs the flow on that cluster using `DaskExecutor`.

    Example:
    ```python
    # using a RemoteDaskEnvironment with an existing Dask cluster

    env = RemoteDaskEnvironment(
        address="tcp://dask_scheduler_host_or_ip:8786"
    )

    f = Flow("dummy flow", environment=env)
    ```

    If using the Security object then it should be filled out like this:

    ```python
    security = Security(tls_ca_file='cluster_ca.pem',
                        tls_client_cert='cli_cert.pem',
                        tls_client_key='cli_key.pem',
                        require_encryption=True)
    ```

    Args:
        - address (str): an address of the scheduler of a Dask cluster in URL form,
            e.g. `tcp://172.33.17.28:8786`
        - security (Security, optional): a Dask Security object from `distributed.security.Security`.
            Use this to connect to a Dask cluster that is enabled with TLS encryption.
        - executor_kwargs (dict, optional): a dictionary of kwargs to be passed to
            the executor; defaults to an empty dictionary
        - labels (List[str], optional): a list of labels, which are arbitrary string identifiers used by Prefect
            Agents when polling for work
        - on_start (Callable, optional): a function callback which will be called before the flow begins to run
        - on_exit (Callable, optional): a function callback which will be called after the flow finishes its run
