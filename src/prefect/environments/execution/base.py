"""
Environments are JSON-serializable objects that fully describe how to run a flow. Serialization
schemas are contained in `prefect.serialization.environment.py`.

Different Environment objects correspond to different computation environments. Environments
that are written on top of a type of infrastructure also define how to set up and execute
that environment. e.g. the `DaskKubernetesEnvironment` is an environment which
runs a flow on Kubernetes using the `dask-kubernetes` library.

    An environment is an object that can be instantiated in a way that makes it possible to
    call `environment.setup()` to stand up any required static infrastructure and
    `environment.execute()` to execute the flow inside this environment.

    The `setup` and `execute` functions of an environment require a Prefect Flow object.

            flow begins to run
