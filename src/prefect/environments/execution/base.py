"""
Environments are JSON-serializable objects that fully describe how to run a flow. Serialization
schemas are contained in `prefect.serialization.environment.py`.

Different Environment objects correspond to different computation environments. Environments
that are written on top of a type of infrastructure also define how to set up and execute
that environment. e.g. the `DaskKubernetesEnvironment` is an environment which
runs a flow on Kubernetes using the `dask-kubernetes` library.

Some of the information that the environment requires to run a flow -- such as the flow
itself -- may not available when the Environment class is instantiated. Therefore, Environments
are accompanied with a Storage objects to specify how and where the flow is stored. For example,
the `DaskKubernetesEnvironment` requires the flow to be stored in a `Docker` storage object.

    The `setup` and `execute` functions of an environment require a Prefect Storage object which
    specifies how and where the flow is stored.
