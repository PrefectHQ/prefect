    Local storage class.  This class represents the Storage
    interface for Flows stored as bytes in the local filesystem.

    Note that if you register a Flow with Prefect Cloud using this storage,
    your flow's environment will automatically be labeled with your machine's hostname.
    This ensures that only agents that are known to be running on the same filesystem can
    run your flow.

    Args:
        - directory (str, optional): the directory the flows will be stored in;
            defaults to `~/.prefect/flows`.  If it doesn't already exist, it will be
            created for you.
        - validate (bool, optional): a boolean specifying whether to validate the
            provided directory path; if `True`, the directory will be converted to an
            absolute path and created.  Defaults to `True`
        - path (str, optional): a direct path to the location of the flow file if
            `stored_as_script=True`, otherwise this path will be used when storing the serialized,
            pickled flow. If `stored_as_script=True`, the direct path may be a file path
            (such as 'path/to/myflow.py') or a direct python path (such as 'myrepo.mymodule.myflow')
        - stored_as_script (bool, optional): boolean for specifying if the flow has been stored
            as a `.py` file. Defaults to `False`
