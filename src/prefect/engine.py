    Pauses the current flow run by blocking execution until resumed.

    When called within a flow run, execution will block and no downstream tasks will
    run until the flow is resumed. Task runs that have already started will continue
    running. A timeout parameter can be passed that will fail the flow run if it has not
    been resumed within the specified time.

    Args:
        flow_run_id: a flow run id. If supplied, this function will attempt to pause
            the specified flow run outside of the flow run process. When paused, the
            flow run will continue execution until the NEXT task is orchestrated, at
            which point the flow will exit. Any tasks that have already started will
            run until completion. When resumed, the flow run will be rescheduled to
            finish execution. In order pause a flow run in this way, the flow needs to
            have an associated deployment and results need to be configured with the
            `persist_results` option.
        timeout: the number of seconds to wait for the flow to be resumed before
            failing. Defaults to 1 hour (3600 seconds). If the pause timeout exceeds
            any configured flow-level timeout, the flow might fail even after resuming.
        poll_interval: The number of seconds between checking whether the flow has been
            resumed. Defaults to 10 seconds.
        reschedule: Flag that will reschedule the flow run if resumed. Instead of
            blocking execution, the flow will gracefully exit (with no result returned)
            instead. To use this flag, a flow needs to have an associated deployment and
            results need to be configured with the `persist_results` option.
        key: An optional key to prevent calling pauses more than once. This defaults to
            the number of pauses observed by the flow so far, and prevents pauses that
            use the "reschedule" option from running the same pause twice. A custom key
            can be supplied for custom pausing behavior.
        wait_for_input: a subclass of `RunInput` or any type supported by
            Pydantic. If provided when the flow pauses, the flow will wait for the
            input to be provided before resuming. If the flow is resumed without
            providing the input, the flow will fail. If the flow is resumed with the
            input, the flow will resume and the input will be loaded and returned
            from this function.

    Example:
    ```python
    @task
    def task_one():
        for i in range(3):
            sleep(1)

    @flow
    def my_flow():
        terminal_state = task_one.submit(return_state=True)

            print("Task one succeeded! Pausing flow run..")
            pause_flow_run(timeout=2)
        else:
            print("Task one failed. Skipping pause flow run..")
    ```
