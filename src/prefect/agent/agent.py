    Base class for Agents. Information on using the Prefect agents can be found at
    https://docs.prefect.io/orchestration/agents/overview.html

    This Agent class is a standard point for executing Flows through the Prefect API. It is meant to
    have subclasses which inherit functionality from this class. The only piece that the
    subclasses should implement is the `deploy_flows` function, which specifies how to run a
    Flow on the given platform. It is built in this way to keep Prefect API logic standard
    but allows for platform specific customizability.

    In order for this to operate `PREFECT__CLOUD__AGENT__AUTH_TOKEN` must be set as an
    environment variable or in your user configuration file.

    Args:
        - agent_config_id (str, optional): An optional agent configuration ID that can be used to set
            configuration based on an agent from a backend API. If set, all configuration values will be
            pulled from backend agent configuration. If not set, any manual kwargs will be used.
        - name (str, optional): An optional name to give this agent. Can also be set through
            the environment variable `PREFECT__CLOUD__AGENT__NAME`. Defaults to "agent"
        - labels (List[str], optional): a list of labels, which are arbitrary string
            identifiers used by Prefect Agents when polling for work
        - env_vars (dict, optional): a dictionary of environment variables and values that will
            be set on each flow run that this agent submits for execution
        - max_polls (int, optional): maximum number of times the agent will poll the Prefect API
            for flow runs; defaults to infinite
        - agent_address (str, optional): Address to serve internal api at. Currently this is
            just health checks for use by an orchestration layer. Leave blank for no api server
            (default).
        - no_cloud_logs (bool, optional): Disable logging to a Prefect backend for this agent
