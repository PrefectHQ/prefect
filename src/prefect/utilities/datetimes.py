    A helper function for generating task retry delays.

    Args:
        interval (timedelta): The amount of time to wait.
            This value is optional; users can also instantiate a new interval
            by passing keyword arguments directly to retry_delay. So:
                retry_delay(interval=timedelta(days=1))
            is equivalent to:
                retry_delay(days=1)

        **kwargs: Keyword arguments are passed to timedelta and
            are compatible with the datetime.timedelta API.

        exponential_backoff: if True, each retry delay will be exponentially
            longer than the last, starting with the second retry. For example,
            if the retry delay is 1 minute, then:
                - first retry starts after 1 minute
                - second retry also starts after 1 minute (no backoff applied)
                - third retry starts after 2 minutes
                - fourth retry starts after 4 minutes
                - etc.

        max_delay (timedelta): If exponential_backoff is supplied,
            delays will be capped by this amount.
