    Jira Notifier requires a Jira account and API token.  The API token can be created at:
    https://id.atlassian.com/manage/api-tokens The Jira account username ('JIRAUSER'), API
    token ('JIRATOKEN') should be set as part of a 'JIRASECRETS' object in Prefect Secrets.

    An example 'JIRASECRETS' secret configuration looks like:

    ```toml
    [secrets]
    JIRASECRETS.JIRATOKEN = "XXXXXXXXX"
    JIRASECRETS.JIRAUSER = "xxxxx@yyy.com"
    JIRASECRETS.JIRASERVER = "https://???.atlassian.net"
    ```

    The server URL can be set as part of the 'JIRASECRETS' object ('JIRASERVER') or passed to
    the jira notifier state handler as the "server_URL" argument.  Jira Notifier works as a
    standalone state handler, or can be called from within a custom state handler.  This
    function is curried meaning that it can be called multiple times to partially bind any
    keyword arguments (see example below).  Jira Notifier creates a new ticket with the
    information about the task or flow it is bound to when that task or flow is in a specific
    state.  (For example it will create a ticket to tell you that the flow you set it on is in
    a failed state.) You should use the options dictionary to set the project name and issue
    type.  You can use the "assignee" argument to assign that ticket to a specific member of
    your team.

    Args:
        - tracked_obj (Task or Flow): Task or Flow object the handler is registered with
        - old_state (State): previous state of tracked object
        - new_state (State): new state of tracked object
        - options (Dictionary): Must inlucde a 'project' key and an 'issuetype' key (e.g.
            options = {'project': 'TEST', 'issuetype': {'name': 'task'}}). For jira service
            desk tickets, the issue type should use the request type id e.g. 'issuetype':
            {'id': '10010'}. A description can be added using the key 'description'. Custom
            fields can also be added e.g.  'customfield_10017': 'SDTS/flowdown'
        - ignore_states ([State], optional): list of `State` classes to ignore, e.g.,
            `[Running, Scheduled]`. If `new_state` is an instance of one of the passed states,
            no notification will occur.
        - only_states ([State], optional): similar to `ignore_states`, but instead _only_
            notifies you if the Task / Flow is in a state from the provided list of `State`
            classes
        - server_URL (String): The URL of your atlassian account e.g.
            "https://test.atlassian.net".  Can also be set as a Prefect Secret.
        - assignee: the atlassian username of the person you want to assign the ticket to.
            Defaults to "automatic" if this is not set.

    Returns:
        - State: the `new_state` object that was provided

    Raises:
        - ValueError: if the jira ticket creation or assignment fails for any reason

    Example:
        ```python
        from prefect import task
        from prefect.utilities.jira_notification import jira_notifier

        @task(state_handlers=[
            jira_notifier(
                only_states=[Failed],
                options={'project': 'TEST', 'issuetype': {'name': 'Task'}},
                assignee='tester'
            )
        ])
        def add(x, y):
            return x + y
