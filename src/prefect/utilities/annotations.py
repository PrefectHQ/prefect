    Simple wrapper to mark an expression as a different type so it will not be coerced

    quote will also instruct prefect to ignore introspection of the wrapped object
    when passed as flow or task parameter. Parameter introspection can be a
    significant performance hit when the object is a large collection,
    e.g. a large dictionary or DataFrame, and each element needs to be visited. This
    will disable task dependency tracking for the wrapped object, but likely will
    increase performance.
