    The Flow class is used as the representation of a collection of dependent Tasks.  Flows
    track Task dependencies, parameters and provide the main API for constructing and managing
    workflows.

    Initializing Flow example:
    ```python
    class MyTask(Task):
        def run(self):
            return "hello"

    task_1 = MyTask()
    flow = Flow(name="my_flow", tasks=[task_1])

    flow.run()
    ```

    Initializing Flow as context manager example:
    ```python
    @task
    def my_task():
        return "hello"

    with Flow("my_flow") as flow:
        task_1 = my_task()

    flow.run()
    ```

        - name (str): The name of the flow. Cannot be `None` or an empty string
        - schedule (prefect.schedules.Schedule, optional): A default schedule for the flow
        - executor (prefect.executors.Executor, optional): The executor that the flow
           should use. If `None`, the default executor configured in the runtime environment
           will be used.
        - environment (prefect.environments.Environment, optional, DEPRECATED): The environment
           that the flow should be run in.
        - run_config (prefect.run_configs.RunConfig, optional): The runtime
           configuration to use when deploying this flow.
        - storage (prefect.storage.Storage, optional): The unit of storage
            that the flow will be written into.
        - tasks ([Task], optional): If provided, a list of tasks that will initialize the flow
        - edges ([Edge], optional): A list of edges between tasks
        - reference_tasks ([Task], optional): A list of tasks that determine the final
            state of a flow
        - result (Result, optional): the result instance used to retrieve and store
            task results during execution
        - state_handlers (Iterable[Callable], optional): A list of state change handlers
            that will be called whenever the flow changes state, providing an
            opportunity to inspect or modify the new state. The handler
            will be passed the flow instance, the old (prior) state, and the new
            (current) state, with the following signature:
                `state_handler(flow: Flow, old_state: State, new_state: State) -> Optional[State]`
            If multiple functions are passed, then the `new_state` argument will be the
            result of the previous handler.
        - on_failure (Callable, optional): A function with signature `fn(flow: Flow, state:
            State) -> None` which will be called anytime this Flow enters a failure state
        - validate (bool, optional): Whether or not to check the validity of
            the flow (e.g., presence of cycles and illegal keys) after adding the edges passed
            in the `edges` argument. Defaults to the value of `eager_edge_validation` in
            your prefect configuration file.
        -  terminal_state_handler (Callable, optional): A state handler that can be used to
            inspect or modify the final state of the flow run. Expects a callable with signature
            `handler(flow: Flow, state: State, reference_task_states: Set[State]) -> Optional[State]`,

            `reference_task_states` is set of states for all reference tasks in the flow. It should
            return either a new state for the flow run, or `None` (in which case the existing
