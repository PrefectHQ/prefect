    Waits for the prefect flow run to finish and returns the FlowRun

    Args:
        flow_run_id: The flow run ID for the flow run to wait for.
        timeout: The wait timeout in seconds. Defaults to 10800 (3 hours).
        poll_interval: The poll interval in seconds. Defaults to 5.

    Returns:
        FlowRun: The finished flow run.

    Raises:
        prefect.exceptions.FlowWaitTimeout: If flow run goes over the timeout.

    Examples:
        Create a flow run for a deployment and wait for it to finish:
            ```python
            import asyncio

            from prefect import get_client

            async def main():
                async with get_client() as client:
                    flow_run = await client.create_flow_run_from_deployment(deployment_id="my-deployment-id")
                    flow_run = await wait_for_flow_run(flow_run_id=flow_run.id)
                    print(flow_run.state)

            if __name__ == "__main__":
                asyncio.run(main())

            ```

        Trigger multiple flow runs and wait for them to finish:
            ```python
            import asyncio

            from prefect import get_client

            async def main(num_runs: int):
