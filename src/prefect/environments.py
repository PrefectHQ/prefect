"""
Environments are JSON-serializable objects that fully describe how to run a flow. Serialization
schemas are contained in `prefect.serialization.environment.py`.

Different Environment objects correspond to different computation environments -- for
example, a `LocalEnvironment` runs a flow in the local process; a `ContainerEnvironment`
runs a flow in a Docker container.

Some of the information that the environment requires to run a flow -- such as the flow
itself -- may not available when the Environment class is instantiated. Therefore, Environments
may be created with a subset of their (ultimate) required information, and the rest can be
provided when the environment's `build()` method is called.

The most basic Environment is a `LocalEnvironment`. This class stores a serialized version
of a Flow and deserializes it to run it. It is expected that most other Environments
will manipulate LocalEnvironments to actually run their flows. For example, the
`ContainerEnvironment` deploys a Docker container with all necessary dependencies installed
and also a serialized `LocalEnvironment`. When the `ContainerEnvironment` runs the
container, the container in turn runs the `LocalEnvironment`.
