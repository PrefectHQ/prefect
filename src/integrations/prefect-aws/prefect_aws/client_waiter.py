    Uses the underlying boto3 waiter functionality.

    Args:
        client: The AWS client on which to wait (e.g., 'client_wait', 'ec2', etc).
        waiter_name: The name of the waiter to instantiate.
            You may also use a custom waiter name, if you supply
            an accompanying waiter definition dict.
        aws_credentials: Credentials to use for authentication with AWS.
        waiter_definition: A valid custom waiter model, as a dict. Note that if
            you supply a custom definition, it is assumed that the provided
            'waiter_name' is contained within the waiter definition dict.
        **waiter_kwargs: Arguments to pass to the `waiter.wait(...)` method. Will
            depend upon the specific waiter being called.

    Example:
        Run an ec2 waiter until instance_exists.
        ```python
        from prefect import flow
        from prefect_aws import AwsCredentials
        from prefect_aws.client_wait import client_waiter

        @flow

                aws_access_key_id="acccess_key_id",
                aws_secret_access_key="secret_access_key"
            )

                "ec2",
