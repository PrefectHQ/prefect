# Prefect Integrations

This directory contains official Prefect integrations with external services and platforms. Each integration is a separate package that extends Prefect's functionality.

## Available Integrations

- **Cloud Platforms**: AWS, GCP, Azure
- **Container Orchestration**: Docker, Kubernetes  
- **Databases**: SQLAlchemy, Redis, Snowflake
- **Data Processing**: Dask, Ray, dbt, Databricks
- **Version Control**: GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket
- **Communication**: Slack, Email
- **Shell**: Shell command execution

## Integration Architecture

Each integration typically provides:
- **Blocks**: Reusable configuration objects for connecting to external services
- **Tasks**: Pre-built tasks for common operations  
- **Workers**: Infrastructure adapters for running flows
- **Storage**: Options for storing flow code and artifacts

## Development Notes

- Each integration is self-contained with its own pyproject.toml
- Integrations follow semantic versioning independently
- All integrations share common patterns for authentication and configuration
- Use blocks for connection management rather than raw credentials in flow code
