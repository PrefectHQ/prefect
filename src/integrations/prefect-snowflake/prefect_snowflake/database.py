class SnowflakeConnector(DatabaseBlock):
    """
    Block used to manage connections with Snowflake.

    Upon instantiating, a connection is created and maintained for the life of
    the object until the close method is called.

    It is recommended to use this block as a context manager, which will automatically
    close the engine and its connections when the context is exited.

    It is also recommended that this block is loaded and consumed within a single task
    or flow because if the block is passed across separate tasks and flows,
    the state of the block's connection and cursor will be lost.

    Args:
        credentials: The credentials to authenticate with Snowflake.
        database: The name of the default database to use.
        warehouse: The name of the default warehouse to use.
        schema: The name of the default schema to use;
            this attribute is accessible through `SnowflakeConnector(...).schema_`.
        fetch_size: The number of rows to fetch at a time.
        poll_frequency_s: The number of seconds before checking query.

    Examples:
        Load stored Snowflake connector as a context manager:
        ```python
        from prefect_snowflake.database import SnowflakeConnector

        snowflake_connector = SnowflakeConnector.load("BLOCK_NAME")
        ```

        Insert data into database and fetch results.
        ```python
        from prefect_snowflake.database import SnowflakeConnector

        with SnowflakeConnector.load("BLOCK_NAME") as conn:
            conn.execute(
