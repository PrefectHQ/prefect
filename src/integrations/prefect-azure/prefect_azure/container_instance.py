Integrations with the Azure Container Instances service.
Note this module is experimental. The interfaces within may change without notice.

The `AzureContainerInstanceJob` infrastructure block in this module is ideally
configured via the Prefect UI and run via a Prefect agent, but it can be called directly
as demonstrated in the following examples.

Examples:
    Run a command using an Azure Container Instances container.
    ```python
    AzureContainerInstanceJob(command=["echo", "hello world"]).run()
    ```

    Run a command and stream the container's output to the local terminal.
    ```python
    AzureContainerInstanceJob(
        command=["echo", "hello world"],
        stream_output=True,
    )
    ```

    Run a command with a specific image
    ```python
    AzureContainerInstanceJob(command=["echo", "hello world"], image="alpine:latest")
    ```

    Run a task with custom memory and CPU requirements
    ```python
    AzureContainerInstanceJob(command=["echo", "hello world"], memory=1.0, cpu=1.0)
    ```

    Run a task with custom memory and CPU requirements
    ```python
    AzureContainerInstanceJob(command=["echo", "hello world"], memory=1.0, cpu=1.0)
    ```

    Run a task with custom memory, CPU, and GPU requirements
    ```python
    AzureContainerInstanceJob(command=["echo", "hello world"], memory=1.0, cpu=1.0,
    gpu_count=1, gpu_sku="V100")
    ```

    Run a task with custom environment variables
    ```python
    AzureContainerInstanceJob(
        command=["echo", "hello $PLANET"],
        env={"PLANET": "earth"}
    )
    ```

    Run a task that uses a private ACR registry with a managed identity
    ```python
    AzureContainerInstanceJob(
        command=["echo", "hello $PLANET"],
        image="my-registry.azurecr.io/my-image",
        image_registry=ACRManagedIdentity(
            registry_url="my-registry.azurecr.io",
            identity="/my/managed/identity/123abc"
        )
    )
    ```
