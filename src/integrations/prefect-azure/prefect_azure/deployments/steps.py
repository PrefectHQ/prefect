"""
Prefect deployment steps for code storage and retrieval in Azure Blob Storage.

These steps can be used in a `prefect.yaml` file to define the default
push and pull steps for a group of deployments, or they can be used to
define the push and pull steps for a specific deployment.

!!! example
    Sample `prefect.yaml` file that is configured to push and pull to and
    from an Azure Blob Storage container:

    ```yaml
    prefect_version: ...
    name: ...

    push:
        - prefect_azure.deployments.steps.push_to_azure_blob_storage:
            requires: prefect-azure[blob_storage]
            container: my-container
            folder: my-folder
            credentials: "{{ prefect.blocks.azure-blob-storage-credentials.dev-credentials }}"

    pull:
        - prefect_azure.deployments.steps.pull_from_azure_blob_storage:
            requires: prefect-azure[blob_storage]
            container: "{{ container }}"
            folder: "{{ folder }}"
            credentials: "{{ prefect.blocks.azure-blob-storage-credentials.dev-credentials }}"
    ```

!!! note
    Azure Storage account needs to have Hierarchical Namespace disabled.
