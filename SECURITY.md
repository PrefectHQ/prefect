# How to report a security issue

To report a (suspected) security issue, please email `bugbounty@prefect.io` and follow the instructions for our [bug bounty program](https://www.prefect.io/bug-bounty).

Prefect will acknowledge receipt of your report in a timely manner, usually within 48 hours. After the initial reply to your report, the security team will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.
