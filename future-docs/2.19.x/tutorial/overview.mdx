Prefect orchestrates workflows â€” it simplifies the creation, scheduling, and monitoring of complex data pipelines. You define workflows as Python code and Prefect handles the rest.

Prefect also provides error handling, retry mechanisms, and a user-friendly dashboard for monitoring. It's the easiest way to transform any Python function into a unit of work that can be observed and orchestrated.

This tutorial provides a guided walk-through of Prefect's core concepts and instructions on how to use them.

You will:

1.  [Create a flow](https://docs.prefect.io/tutorial/flows/)
2.  [Add tasks to it](https://docs.prefect.io/tutorial/tasks/)
3.  [Deploy and run the flow locally](https://docs.prefect.io/tutorial/deployments/)
4.  [Create a work pool and run the flow on remote infrastructure](https://docs.prefect.io/tutorial/work-pools/)

These four topics will get most users to their first production deployment.

Advanced users that need more governance and control of their workflow infrastructure can go one step further by:

5.[Using a worker-based deployment](https://docs.prefect.io/tutorial/workers/)

If you're looking for examples of more advanced operations (such as [deploying on Kubernetes](https://docs.prefect.io/guides/deployment/kubernetes/)), check out Prefect's [guides](https://docs.prefect.io/guides/).

Compared to the [Quickstart](https://docs.prefect.io/getting-started/quickstart/), this tutorial is a more in-depth guide to Prefect's functionality. You will also see how to customize the Docker image where your flow runs and learn how to run flows on your own infrastructure.

Prerequisites
-------------------------------------------------

Before you start, make sure you have Python installed in a virtual environment. Then install Prefect:

```
pip install -U prefect
```

See the [install guide](https://docs.prefect.io/getting-started/installation/) for more detailed instructions.

To get the most out of Prefect, you need to connect to a forever-free [Prefect Cloud](https://app.prefect.cloud/) account.

    1.  Create a new account or sign in at [https://app.prefect.cloud/](https://app.prefect.cloud/).
    2.  Use the `prefect cloud login` CLI command to [authenticate to Prefect Cloud](https://docs.prefect.io/cloud/users/api-keys/) from your environment.

Choose **Log in with a web browser** and click the **Authorize** button in the browser window that opens.

If you have any issues with browser-based authentication, see the [Prefect Cloud docs](https://docs.prefect.io/cloud/users/api-keys/) to learn how to authenticate with a manually created API key.

As an alternative to using Prefect Cloud, you can self-host a [Prefect server instance](https://docs.prefect.io/host/). If you choose this option, run `prefect server start` to start a local Prefect server instance.
