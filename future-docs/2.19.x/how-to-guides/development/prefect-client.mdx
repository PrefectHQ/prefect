title: Using the Prefect Orchestration Client
sidebarTitle: Prefect Client
---

Overview
---------------------------------------

In the [API reference for the `PrefectClient`](https://docs.prefect.io/api-ref/prefect/client/orchestration/), you can find many useful client methods that make it simpler to do things such as:

*   [reschedule late flow runs](#rescheduling-late-flow-runs)
*   [get the last `N` completed flow runs from my workspace](#get-the-last-n-completed-flow-runs-from-my-workspace)

The `PrefectClient` is an async context manager, so you can use it like this:

```python
from prefect import get_client

async with get_client() as client:
    response = await client.hello()
    print(response.json()) # ðŸ‘‹

```


Examples
---------------------------------------

### Rescheduling late flow runs

Sometimes, you may need to bulk reschedule flow runs that are late - for example, if you've accidentally scheduled many flow runs of a deployment to an inactive work pool.

To do this, we can delete late flow runs and create new ones in a `Scheduled` state with a delay.

This example reschedules the last 3 late flow runs of a deployment named `healthcheck-storage-test` to run 6 hours later than their original expected start time. It also deletes any remaining late flow runs of that deployment.

```python 
import asyncio
from datetime import datetime, timedelta, timezone
from typing import Optional

from prefect import get_client
from prefect.client.schemas.filters import (
    DeploymentFilter, FlowRunFilter
)
from prefect.client.schemas.objects import FlowRun
from prefect.client.schemas.sorting import FlowRunSort
from prefect.states import Scheduled

async def reschedule_late_flow_runs(
    deployment_name: str,
    delay: timedelta,
    most_recent_n: int,
    delete_remaining: bool = True,
    states: Optional[list[str]] = None
) -> list[FlowRun]:
    if not states:
        states = ["Late"]

    async with get_client() as client:
        flow_runs = await client.read_flow_runs(
            flow_run_filter=FlowRunFilter(
                state=dict(name=dict(any_=states)),
                expected_start_time=dict(
                    before_=datetime.now(timezone.utc)
                ),
            ),
            deployment_filter=DeploymentFilter(
                name={'like_': deployment_name}
            ),
            sort=FlowRunSort.START_TIME_DESC,
            limit=most_recent_n if not delete_remaining else None
        )

        if not flow_runs:
            print(f"No flow runs found in states: {states!r}")
            return []

        rescheduled_flow_runs = []
        for i, run in enumerate(flow_runs):
            await client.delete_flow_run(flow_run_id=run.id)
            if i < most_recent_n:
                new_run = await client.create_flow_run_from_deployment(
                    deployment_id=run.deployment_id,
                    state=Scheduled(
                        scheduled_time=run.expected_start_time + delay
                    ),
                )
                rescheduled_flow_runs.append(new_run)

        return rescheduled_flow_runs

if __name__ == "__main__":
    rescheduled_flow_runs = asyncio.run(
        reschedule_late_flow_runs(
            deployment_name="healthcheck-storage-test",
            delay=timedelta(hours=6),
            most_recent_n=3,
        )
    )

    print(f"Rescheduled {len(rescheduled_flow_runs)} flow runs")

    assert all(
        run.state.is_scheduled() for run in rescheduled_flow_runs
    )
    assert all(
        run.expected_start_time > datetime.now(timezone.utc)
        for run in rescheduled_flow_runs
    )

```


### Get the last `N` completed flow runs from my workspace

To get the last `N` completed flow runs from our workspace, we can make use of `read_flow_runs` and `prefect.client.schemas`.

This example gets the last three completed flow runs from our workspace:

```python 
import asyncio
from typing import Optional

from prefect import get_client
from prefect.client.schemas.filters import FlowRunFilter
from prefect.client.schemas.objects import FlowRun
from prefect.client.schemas.sorting import FlowRunSort

async def get_most_recent_flow_runs(
    n: int = 3,
    states: Optional[list[str]] = None
) -> list[FlowRun]:
    if not states:
        states = ["COMPLETED"]

    async with get_client() as client:
        return await client.read_flow_runs(
            flow_run_filter=FlowRunFilter(
                state={'type': {'any_': states}}
            ),
            sort=FlowRunSort.END_TIME_DESC,
            limit=n,
        )

if __name__ == "__main__":
    last_3_flow_runs: list[FlowRun] = asyncio.run(
        get_most_recent_flow_runs()
    )
    print(last_3_flow_runs)

    assert all(
        run.state.is_completed() for run in last_3_flow_runs
    )
    assert (
        end_times := [run.end_time for run in last_3_flow_runs]
    ) == sorted(end_times, reverse=True)

```


Instead of the last three from the whole workspace, you could also use the `DeploymentFilter` like the previous example to get the last three completed flow runs of a specific deployment.

### Transition all running flows to cancelled via the Client

It can be cumbersome to cancel many flow runs through the UI. You can use `get_client`to set multiple runs to a `Cancelled` state. The code below will cancel all flow runs that are in `Pending`, `Running`, `Scheduled`, or `Late` states when the script is run.

```
import anyio

from prefect import get_client
from prefect.client.schemas.filters import FlowRunFilter, FlowRunFilterState, FlowRunFilterStateName
from prefect.client.schemas.objects import StateType

async def list_flow_runs_with_states(states: list[str]):
    async with get_client() as client:
        flow_runs = await client.read_flow_runs(
            flow_run_filter=FlowRunFilter(
                state=FlowRunFilterState(
                    name=FlowRunFilterStateName(any_=states)
                )
            )
        )
    return flow_runs


async def cancel_flow_runs(flow_runs):
    async with get_client() as client:
        for idx, flow_run in enumerate(flow_runs):
            print(f"[{idx + 1}] Cancelling flow run '{flow_run.name}' with ID '{flow_run.id}'")
            state_updates = {}
            state_updates.setdefault("name", "Cancelled")
            state_updates.setdefault("type", StateType.CANCELLED)
            state = flow_run.state.copy(update=state_updates)
            await client.set_flow_run_state(flow_run.id, state, force=True)


async def bulk_cancel_flow_runs():
    states = ["Pending", "Running", "Scheduled", "Late"]
    flow_runs = await list_flow_runs_with_states(states)

    while len(flow_runs) > 0:
        print(f"Cancelling {len(flow_runs)} flow runs\n")
        await cancel_flow_runs(flow_runs)
        flow_runs = await list_flow_runs_with_states(states)
    print("Done!")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    anyio.run(bulk_cancel_flow_runs)

```
<Tip>
**There are other ways to filter objects like flow runs**

See [`the filters API reference`](https://docs.prefect.io/api-ref/prefect/client/schemas/#prefect.client.schemas.filters) for more ways to filter flow runs and other objects in your Prefect ecosystem.
