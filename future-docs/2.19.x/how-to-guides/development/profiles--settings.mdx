Prefect's local settings are [documented](https://docs.prefect.io/2.19.1/api-ref/prefect/settings/#prefect.settings.Settings) and type-validated.

By modifying the default settings, you can customize various aspects of the system. You can override a setting with an environment variable or by updating the setting in a Prefect [profile](#configuration-profiles).

Prefect profiles are persisted groups of settings on your local machine. A single profile is always active.

Initially, a default profile named `default` is active and contains no settings overrides.

All currently active settings can be viewed from the command line by running the following command:

```
prefect config view --show-defaults

```


When you switch to a different profile, all of the settings configured in the newly activated profile are applied.

Commonly configured settings
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This section describes some commonly configured settings. See [Configuring settings](#configuring-settings) for details on setting and unsetting configuration values.

### PREFECT\_API\_KEY

The `PREFECT_API_KEY` value specifies the [API key](https://docs.prefect.io/ui/cloud-api-keys/#create-an-api-key) used to authenticate with Prefect Cloud.

```python
PREFECT_API_KEY="[API-KEY]"

```


Generally, you will set the `PREFECT_API_URL` and `PREFECT_API_KEY` for your active profile by running `prefect cloud login`. If you're curious, read more about [managing API keys](https://docs.prefect.io/cloud/users/api-keys/).

### PREFECT\_API\_URL

The `PREFECT_API_URL` value specifies the API endpoint of your Prefect Cloud workspace or a self-hosted Prefect server instance.

For example, if using Prefect Cloud:

```
PREFECT_API_URL="https://api.prefect.cloud/api/accounts/[ACCOUNT-ID]/workspaces/[WORKSPACE-ID]"

```


You can view your Account ID and Workspace ID in your browser URL when at a Prefect Cloud workspace page. For example: [https://app.prefect.cloud/account/abc-my-account-id-is-here/workspaces/123-my-workspace-id-is-here](https://app.prefect.cloud/account/abc-my-account-id-is-here/workspaces/123-my-workspace-id-is-here).

If using a local Prefect server instance, set your API URL like this:

```
PREFECT_API_URL="http://127.0.0.1:4200/api"

```

<Tip>
### `PREFECT_API_URL` setting for workers

If using a [worker](https://docs.prefect.io/concepts/work-pools/) (agent and block-based deployments are legacy) that can create flow runs for deployments in remote environments, [`PREFECT_API_URL`](https://docs.prefect.io/concepts/settings/) must be set for the environment in which your worker is running.

If you want the worker to communicate with Prefect Cloud or a Prefect server instance from a remote execution environment such as a VM or Docker container, you must configure `PREFECT_API_URL` in that environment.
</Tip>

<Tip>
### Running the Prefect UI behind a reverse proxy

When using a reverse proxy (such as [Nginx](https://nginx.org/) or [Traefik](https://traefik.io/)) to proxy traffic to a locally-hosted Prefect UI instance, the Prefect server instance also needs to be configured to know how to connect to the API. The [`PREFECT_UI_API_URL`](https://docs.prefect.io/2.19.1/api-ref/prefect/settings/#PREFECT_UI_API_URL) should be set to the external proxy URL (e.g. if your external URL is [https://prefect-server.example.com/](https://prefect-server.example.com/) then set `PREFECT_UI_API_URL=https://prefect-server.example.com/api` for the Prefect server process). You can also accomplish this by setting [`PREFECT_API_URL`](https://docs.prefect.io/concepts/settings/#prefect.settings.PREFECT_API_URL) to the API URL, as this setting is used as a fallback if `PREFECT_UI_API_URL` is not set.
</Tip>

### PREFECT\_HOME

The `PREFECT_HOME` value specifies the local Prefect directory for configuration files, profiles, and the location of the default [Prefect SQLite database](https://docs.prefect.io/concepts/database/).

```
PREFECT_HOME='~/.prefect'

```


### PREFECT\_LOCAL\_STORAGE\_PATH

The `PREFECT_LOCAL_STORAGE_PATH` value specifies the default location of local storage for flow runs.

```
PREFECT_LOCAL_STORAGE_PATH='${PREFECT_HOME}/storage'

```


### CSRF Protection Settings

If using a local Prefect server instance, you can configure CSRF protection settings.

`PREFECT_SERVER_CSRF_PROTECTION_ENABLED` - Activates CSRF protection on the server, requiring valid CSRF tokens for applicable requests. Recommended for production to prevent CSRF attacks. Defaults to False.

```
PREFECT_SERVER_CSRF_PROTECTION_ENABLED=True

```


`PREFECT_SERVER_CSRF_TOKEN_EXPIRATION` - Sets the expiration duration for server-issued CSRF tokens, influencing how often tokens need to be refreshed. The default is 1 hour.

```
PREFECT_SERVER_CSRF_TOKEN_EXPIRATION='3600'  # 1 hour in seconds

```


By default clients expect that CSRF protection is enabled on the server. If you are running a server without CSRF protection, you can disable CSRF support in the client.

`PREFECT_CLIENT_CSRF_SUPPORT_ENABLED` - Enables or disables CSRF token handling in the Prefect client. When enabled, the client manages CSRF tokens for state-changing API requests. Defaults to True.

```
PREFECT_CLIENT_CSRF_SUPPORT_ENABLED=True

```


### Database settings

If running a self-hosted Prefect server instance, there are several database configuration settings you can read about [here](https://docs.prefect.io/host/).

### Logging settings

Prefect provides several logging configuration settings that you can read about in the [logging docs](https://docs.prefect.io/concepts/logs/).

Configuring settings
---------------------------------------------------------------

The `prefect config` CLI commands enable you to view, set, and unset settings.


|Command|Description                             |
|-------|----------------------------------------|
|set    |Change the value for a setting.         |
|unset  |Restore the default value for a setting.|
|view   |Display the current settings.           |


### Viewing settings from the CLI

The `prefect config view` command will display settings that override default values.

```
$ prefect config view
PREFECT_PROFILE="default"
PREFECT_LOGGING_LEVEL='DEBUG'

```


You can show the sources of values with `--show-sources`:

```
$ prefect config view --show-sources
PREFECT_PROFILE="default"
PREFECT_LOGGING_LEVEL='DEBUG' (from env)

```


You can also include default values with `--show-defaults`:

```
$ prefect config view --show-defaults
PREFECT_PROFILE='default'
PREFECT_AGENT_PREFETCH_SECONDS='10' (from defaults)
PREFECT_AGENT_QUERY_INTERVAL='5.0' (from defaults)
PREFECT_API_KEY='None' (from defaults)
PREFECT_API_REQUEST_TIMEOUT='60.0' (from defaults)
PREFECT_API_URL='None' (from defaults)
...

```


### Setting and clearing values

The `prefect config set` command lets you change the value of a default setting.

A commonly used example is setting the `PREFECT_API_URL`, which you may need to change when interacting with different Prefect server instances or Prefect Cloud.

```
# use a local Prefect server
prefect config set PREFECT_API_URL="http://127.0.0.1:4200/api"

# use Prefect Cloud
prefect config set PREFECT_API_URL="https://api.prefect.cloud/api/accounts/[ACCOUNT-ID]/workspaces/[WORKSPACE-ID]"

```


If you want to configure a setting to use its default value, use the `prefect config unset` command.

```
prefect config unset PREFECT_API_URL

```


### Overriding defaults with environment variables

All settings have keys that match the environment variable that can be used to override them.

For example, configuring the home directory:

```
# environment variable
export PREFECT_HOME="/path/to/home"

```


```
# python
import prefect.settings
prefect.settings.PREFECT_HOME.value()  # PosixPath('/path/to/home')

```


Configuring the a server instance's port:

```
# environment variable
export PREFECT_SERVER_API_PORT=4242

```


```
# python
prefect.settings.PREFECT_SERVER_API_PORT.value()  # 4242

```


Configuration profiles
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Prefect allows you to persist settings instead of setting an environment variable each time you open a new shell. Settings are persisted to profiles, which allow you to move between groups of settings quickly.

The `prefect profile` CLI commands enable you to create, review, and manage profiles.


|Command|Description                                               |
|-------|----------------------------------------------------------|
|create |Create a new profile.                                     |
|delete |Delete the given profile.                                 |
|inspect|Display settings from a given profile; defaults to active.|
|ls     |List profile names.                                       |
|rename |Change the name of a profile.                             |
|use    |Switch the active profile.                                |


If you configured settings for a profile, `prefect profile inspect` displays those settings:

```ruby
$ prefect profile inspect
PREFECT_PROFILE = "default"
PREFECT_API_KEY = "pnu_XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
PREFECT_API_URL = "http://127.0.0.1:4200/api"

```


You can pass the name of a profile to view its settings:

```ruby
$ prefect profile create test
$ prefect profile inspect test
PREFECT_PROFILE="test"

```


### Creating and removing profiles

Create a new profile with no settings:

```ruby
$ prefect profile create test
Created profile 'test' at /Users/terry/.prefect/profiles.toml.

```


Create a new profile `foo` with settings cloned from an existing `default` profile:

```ruby
$ prefect profile create foo --from default
Created profile 'cloud' matching 'default' at /Users/terry/.prefect/profiles.toml.

```


Rename a profile:

```ruby
$ prefect profile rename temp test
Renamed profile 'temp' to 'test'.

```


Remove a profile:

```ruby
$ prefect profile delete test
Removed profile 'test'.

```


Removing the default profile resets it:

```ruby
$ prefect profile delete default
Reset profile 'default'.

```


### Change values in profiles

Set a value in the current profile:

```ruby
$ prefect config set VAR=X
Set variable 'VAR' to 'X'
Updated profile 'default'

```


Set multiple values in the current profile:

```ruby
$ prefect config set VAR2=Y VAR3=Z
Set variable 'VAR2' to 'Y'
Set variable 'VAR3' to 'Z'
Updated profile 'default'

```


You can set a value in another profile by passing the `--profile NAME` option to a CLI command:

```ruby
$ prefect --profile "foo" config set VAR=Y
Set variable 'VAR' to 'Y'
Updated profile 'foo'

```


Unset values in the current profile to restore the defaults:

```ruby
$ prefect config unset VAR2 VAR3
Unset variable 'VAR2'
Unset variable 'VAR3'
Updated profile 'default'

```


### Inspecting profiles

See a list of available profiles:

```ruby
$ prefect profile ls
* default
cloud
test
local

```


View all settings for a profile:

```ruby
$ prefect profile inspect cloud
PREFECT_API_URL='https://api.prefect.cloud/api/accounts/xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxx
x/workspaces/xxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx'
PREFECT_API_KEY='xxx_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx'          

```


### Using profiles

The profile named `default` is used by default. There are several methods to switch to another profile.

The recommended method is to use the `prefect profile use` command with the name of the profile:

```ruby
$ prefect profile use foo
Profile 'test' now active.

```


Alternatively, you can set the environment variable `PREFECT_PROFILE` to the name of the profile:

```ruby
export PREFECT_PROFILE=foo

```


Or, specify the profile in the CLI command for one-time usage:

```ruby
prefect --profile "foo" ...

```


Note that this option must come before the subcommand. For example, to list flow runs using the profile `foo`:

```ruby
prefect --profile "foo" flow-run ls

```


You may use the `-p` flag as well:

```ruby
prefect -p "foo" flow-run ls

```


You may also create an 'alias' to automatically use your profile:

```ruby
$ alias prefect-foo="prefect --profile 'foo' "
# uses our profile!
$ prefect-foo config view  

```


Conflicts with environment variables
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If setting the profile from the CLI with `--profile`, environment variables that conflict with settings in the profile will be ignored.

In all other cases, environment variables will take precedence over the value in the profile.

For example, a value set in a profile will be used by default:

```ruby
$ prefect config set PREFECT_LOGGING_LEVEL="ERROR"
$ prefect config view --show-sources
PREFECT_PROFILE="default"
PREFECT_LOGGING_LEVEL='ERROR' (from profile)

```


But, setting an environment variable will override the profile setting:

```ruby
$ export PREFECT_LOGGING_LEVEL="DEBUG"
$ prefect config view --show-sources
PREFECT_PROFILE="default"
PREFECT_LOGGING_LEVEL='DEBUG' (from env)

```


Unless the profile is explicitly requested when using the CLI:

```ruby
$ prefect --profile default config view --show-sources
PREFECT_PROFILE="default"
PREFECT_LOGGING_LEVEL='ERROR' (from profile)

```


Profile files
-------------------------------------------------

Profiles are persisted to the file location specified by `PREFECT_PROFILES_PATH`. The default location is a `profiles.toml` file in the `PREFECT_HOME` directory:

```ruby
$ prefect config view --show-defaults
...
PREFECT_PROFILES_PATH='${PREFECT_HOME}/profiles.toml'
...

```


The [TOML](https://toml.io/en/) format is used to store profile data.
