title: Read and Write Data to and from Cloud Provider StorageÂ¶
sidebarTitle: Read and Write Data
---

Writing data to cloud-based storage and reading data from that storage is a common task in data engineering. In this guide we'll learn how to use Prefect to move data to and from AWS, Azure, and GCP blob storage.

Prerequisites
-------------------------------------------------

*   Prefect [installed](https://docs.prefect.io/getting-started/installation/)
*   Authenticated with [Prefect Cloud](https://docs.prefect.io/cloud/cloud-quickstart/) (or self-hosted [Prefect server](https://docs.prefect.io/guides/host/) instance)
*   A cloud provider account (e.g. [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/))

Install relevant Prefect integration library
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the CLI, install the Prefect integration library for your cloud provider:
<Tabs>
  <Tab title="AWS">
[prefect-aws](https://prefecthq.github.io/prefect-aws/) provides blocks for interacting with AWS services.

```
pip install -U prefect-aws

```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Azure">
[prefect-azure](https://prefecthq.github.io/prefect-azure/) provides blocks for interacting with Azure services.

```
 pip install -U prefect-azure

```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="GCP">
[prefect-gcp](https://prefecthq.github.io/prefect-gcp/) provides blocks for interacting with GCP services.

```
 pip install -U prefect-gcp

```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>




Register the block types
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Register the new block types with Prefect Cloud (or with your self-hosted Prefect server instance):

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="AWS">
```
prefect block register -m prefect_aws  

```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Azure">
```
prefect block register -m prefect_azure 

```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="GCP">
```
prefect block register -m prefect_gcp

```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>



We should see a message in the CLI that several block types were registered. If we check the UI, we should see the new block types listed.

Create a storage bucket
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Create a storage bucket in the cloud provider account. Ensure the bucket is publicly accessible or create a user or service account with the appropriate permissions to fetch and write data to the bucket.

Create a credentials block
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

If the bucket is private, there are several options to authenticate:

1.  At deployment runtime, ensure the runtime environment is authenticated.
2.  Create a block with configuration details and reference it when creating the storage block.

If saving credential details in a block we can use a credentials block specific to the cloud provider or use a more generic secret block. We can create [blocks](https://docs.prefect.io/concepts/blocks/) via the UI or Python code. Below we'll use Python code to create a credentials block for our cloud provider.

Credentials safety

Reminder, don't store credential values in public locations such as public git platform repositories. In the examples below we use environment variables to store credential values.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="AWS">
```python
import os
from prefect_aws import AwsCredentials

my_aws_creds = AwsCredentials(
    aws_access_key_id="123abc",
    aws_secret_access_key=os.environ.get("MY_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY"),
)
my_aws_creds.save(name="my-aws-creds-block", overwrite=True)

```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Azure">
```python
import os
from prefect_azure import AzureBlobStorageCredentials

my_azure_creds = AzureBlobStorageCredentials(
    connection_string=os.environ.get("MY_AZURE_CONNECTION_STRING"),
)
my_azure_creds.save(name="my-azure-creds-block", overwrite=True)

```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="GCP">
```python
import os
from prefect_gcp import GCPCredentials

my_gcp_creds = GCPCredentials(
    service_account_info=os.environ.get("GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_FILE_CONTENTS"), 
)
my_gcp_creds.save(name="my-gcp-creds-block", overwrite=True)

```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>


We recommend specifying the service account key file contents as a string, rather than the path to the file, because that file might not be available in your production environments.




Run the code to create the block. We should see a message that the block was created.

Create a storage block
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Let's create a block for the chosen cloud provider using Python code or the UI. In this example we'll use Python code.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="AWS">
Note that the `S3Bucket` block is not the same as the `S3` block that ships with Prefect. The `S3Bucket` block we use in this example is part of the `prefect-aws` library and provides additional functionality.

We'll reference the credentials block created above.

```python
from prefect_aws import S3Bucket

s3bucket = S3Bucket.create(
    bucket="my-bucket-name",
    credentials="my-aws-creds-block"
    )
s3bucket.save(name="my-s3-bucket-block", overwrite=True)

```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Azure">
Note that the `AzureBlobStorageCredentials` block is not the same as the Azure block that ships with Prefect. The `AzureBlobStorageCredentials` block we use in this example is part of the `prefect-azure` library and provides additional functionality.

Azure blob storage doesn't require a separate block, the connection string used in the `AzureBlobStorageCredentials` block can encode the information needed.

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="GCP">
Note that the `GcsBucket` block is not the same as the `GCS` block that ships with Prefect. The `GcsBucket` block is part of the `prefect-gcp` library and provides additional functionality. We'll use it here.

We'll reference the credentials block created above.

```python
from prefect_gcp.cloud_storage import GcsBucket

gcsbucket = GcsBucket(
    bucket="my-bucket-name", 
    credentials="my-gcp-creds-block"
    )
gcsbucket.save(name="my-gcs-bucket-block", overwrite=True)

```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>



Run the code to create the block. We should see a message that the block was created.

Use your new block inside a flow to write data to your cloud provider.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="AWS">
```python
from pathlib import Path
from prefect import flow
from prefect_aws.s3 import S3Bucket

@flow()
def upload_to_s3():
    """Flow function to upload data"""
    path = Path("my_path_to/my_file.parquet")
    aws_block = S3Bucket.load("my-s3-bucket-block")
    aws_block.upload_from_path(from_path=path, to_path=path)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    upload_to_s3()

```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Azure">
```python
from prefect import flow
from prefect_azure import AzureBlobStorageCredentials
from prefect_azure.blob_storage import blob_storage_upload

@flow
def upload_to_azure():
    """Flow function to upload data"""
    blob_storage_credentials = AzureBlobStorageCredentials.load(
        name="my-azure-creds-block"
    )

    with open("my_path_to/my_file.parquet", "rb") as f:
        blob_storage_upload(
            data=f.read(),
            container="my_container",
            blob="my_path_to/my_file.parquet",
            blob_storage_credentials=blob_storage_credentials,
        )

if __name__ == "__main__":
    upload_to_azure()

```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="GCP">
```python

    gcs_block = GcsBucket.load("my-gcs-bucket-block")
    gcs_block.upload_from_path(from_path=path, to_path=path)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    upload_to_gcs()

```
  </Tab>

    s3_block.get_directory(
        from_path="my_path_to/my_file.parquet", 
        local_path="my_path_to/my_file.parquet"
    )

        name="my-azure-creds-block"
    )
    blob_storage_download(
        blob="my_path_to/my_file.parquet",
        container="my_container",
