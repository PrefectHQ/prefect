"""
Base configuration of pytest for testing the 'prefect' module.

Here we make the following changes to pytest:
- Add service flags to the CLI
- Skip tests with the in accordance with service marks and flags
- Override the test event loop to allow async session/module scoped fixtures
- Inject a check for open Prefect client lifespans after every test call
- Create a test Prefect settings profile before test collection that will be used
  for the duration of the test run. This ensures tests are run in a temporary
  environment.

WARNING: Prefect settings cannot be modified in async fixtures.
    Async fixtures are run in a different async context than tests and the modified
    settings will not be present in tests. If a setting needs to be modified by an async
    fixture, a sync fixture must be defined that consumes the async fixture to perform
    the settings context change. See `test_database_connection_url` for example.
