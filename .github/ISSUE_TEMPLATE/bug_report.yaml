**PLEASE READ THIS PARAGRAPH - this helps us identify the root cause and fix the issue:**

Many bug reports are often
**USAGE QUESTIONS, NOT BUGS** - for those, please report your question via our [Community Slack](https://www.prefect.io/slack/) or [Discourse](https://discourse.prefect.io/). We'll then investigate the issue and open a bug report when necessary.

**GUIDELINES FOR REPORTING BUGS**

Your bug report should include the following features:

1. a **succinct description of the problem** - typically a line or two at most

2. **succinct code example which reproduces the problem**, otherwise known as a [Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable](https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve) example.

3. **complete stack traces for errors - please avoid screenshots, and use formatted text inside issues**

4. Additional details that may help us reproduce your issue, including your operating system, the output of the `prefect version` command, or benchmarks for performance issues.
