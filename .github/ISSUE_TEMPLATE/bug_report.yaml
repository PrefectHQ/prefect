**FOR ALL USERS - PLEASE READ THIS PARAGRAPH AS IT IS HELPS US TO DO OUR WORK MORE EFFICIENTLY:**

The **VAST MAJORITY** of bugs reported are in fact
**USAGE QUESTIONS, NOT BUGS** for APIs that can take some practice to familiarize with,
and which are also tailored towards high quality relational designs that
beginners are sometimes less familiar with.

If you are relatively new to SQLAlchemy, and even if not but the issue is uncertain, PLEASE START A NEW
[DISCUSSION](https://github.com/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/discussions/new?category=Usage-Questions) INSTEAD, so that we can
help with your issue.   If you are relatively new to
SQLAlchemy, there is an approximately **90% chance your issue is not a bug and will be converted to a
discussion in any case**.
If your issue is actually a bug, we will open a new bug report with what we need.

**GUIDELINES FOR REPORTING BUGS**

If you are new to SQLAlchemy bug reports, please review our many examples
of [well written bug reports](https://github.com/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3A%22great+mcve%22).   Each of these reports include the following features:

1. a **succinct description of the problem** - typically a line or two at most

2. **succinct, dependency-free code which reproduces the problem**, otherwise known as a [Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable](https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve) example.

3. **complete stack traces for all errors - please avoid screenshots, use formatted text inside issues**

4. Other things as applicable:   **SQL log output**, **database backend and DBAPI driver**,
   **operating system**, **comparative performance timings** for performance issues.
