# Code of Conduct

## Core Rules

1. Be nice ðŸ™‚
2. Be respectful; we assume positive intent from you, and we ask the same in return
3. Avoid posting sensitive information
4. Don't tag other users - we always respond even if it takes some time. If you need SLA-based support, please email [help@prefect.io](mailto:help@prefect.io)
5. Don't post the same question twice across multiple channels - please search before posting
6. Don't advertise material unrelated to Prefect
7. Be explicit rather than implicit - precision is key
8. Disagree politely and constructively when needed
9. Keep topics well-scoped and Prefect-specific

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Everything you post in the Prefect Community (GitHub, Slack) is publicly available. We archive Slack conversations to Linen, making all conversations Google-searchable and visible to the public.
> Don't share any information that you wouldn't be comfortable sharing on Stack Overflow. For private guidance, contact our paid support: cs@prefect.io

## Best Practices

- Specify the problem rather than the solution in titles
- Choose the appropriate category for discussions and issues 
- Keep discussions and issues focused on a single topic
- Mark / upvote helpful answers as accepted solutions
- Include the output of `prefect version` when reporting issues
