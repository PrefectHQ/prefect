We welcome contributors! You can help contribute integrations with the community by following the steps in this guide.

### Generate a project

To help you get started with your integration, we've created a template that gives you the tools to build and publish your integration.

Use the [Prefect Integration Template](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect-collection-template#quickstart) to create an integration with a bootstrapped project.

### List a project in the Integrations Catalog

To list your integration in the Prefect Integrations Catalog, submit a PR to the Prefect repository.

Add a file to the `docs/integrations/catalog` directory with details about your integration. 
Use `TEMPLATE.yaml` in that folder as a guide.

## Contribute fixes or enhancements to integrations

To fix an issue or add a feature to any of our Integrations, propose changes through 
[a pull request from a fork of the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork):

1.  [Fork the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo#forking-a-repository)
2.  [Clone the forked repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo#cloning-your-forked-repository)
3.  Install the repository and its dependencies:

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

4.  Make desired changes
5.  Add tests
6.  Insert an entry to the Integration's CHANGELOG.md
7.  Install `pre-commit` to perform quality checks prior to commit:

```bash
pre-commit install
```

8.  `git commit`, `git push`, and create a pull request
