Sign up for a Prefect Cloud account at [app.prefect.cloud](https://app.prefect.cloud).

An individual user can be invited to become a member of other accounts.

## User settings

Users can access their personal settings in the [profile menu](https://app.prefect.cloud/my/profile), including:

- Profile: View and editing basic information, such as name.
- API keys: Create and view [API keys](/2.17.1/cloud/users/api-keys/) for connecting to Prefect Cloud from the CLI or other environments.
- Preferences: Manage settings, such as color mode and default time zone.
- Feature previews: Enable or disable feature previews.

## Account roles

Users who are part of an account can hold the role of Admin or Member.
Admins can invite other users to join the account and manage the account's workspaces and teams.

Admins on Pro and Custom tier Prefect Cloud accounts can grant members of the account [roles](/2.17.1/cloud/users/roles/) in a workspace, such as Runner or Viewer.
Custom roles are available on Custom tier accounts.
