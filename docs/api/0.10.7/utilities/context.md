# Context
---
This module implements the Prefect context that is available when tasks run.

Tasks can import prefect.context and access attributes that will be overwritten
when the task is run.

Example:

```python
import prefect.context

with prefect.context(a=1, b=2):
    print(prefect.context.a) # 1

print(prefect.context.a) # undefined
```

Prefect provides various key / value pairs in context that are always available during task runs:

| Variable | Description |
| :--- | --- |
| `date` | an actual datetime object representing the current time |
| `today` | the current date formatted as `YYYY-MM-DD`|
| `today_nodash` | the current date formatted as `YYYYMMDD`|
| `yesterday` | yesterday's date formatted as `YYYY-MM-DD`|
| `yesterday_nodash` | yesterday's date formatted as `YYYYMMDD`|
| `tomorrow` | tomorrow's date formatted as `YYYY-MM-DD`|
| `tomorrow_nodash` | tomorrow's date formatted as `YYYYMMDD`|
| `logger` | the logger for the current task |
| `config` | the complete [Prefect configuration](https://docs.prefect.io/core/concepts/configuration.html) object that is being used during this run |
| `flow_name` | the name of the current flow |
| `scheduled_start_time` | a datetime object representing the scheduled start time for the flow run; falls back to `now` for unscheduled runs |
| `parameters` | a dictionary of parameter values for the current flow run |
| `map_index` | the map index of the current task (if mapped, otherwise `None`) |
| `task_name` | the name of the current task |
| `task_full_name` | the name of the current task, including map index |
| `task_slug` | the slug of the current task |
| `task_tags` | the tags on the current task |
| `task_run_count` | the run count of the task run - typically only interesting for retrying tasks |
| `task_loop_count` | if the Task utilizes looping, the loop count of the task run |
| `task_loop_result` | if the Task is looping, the current loop result |

In addition, Prefect Cloud supplies some additional context variables:

| Variable | Description |
| :--- | --- |
| `flow_id` | the id of the current flow |
| `flow_run_id` | the id of the current flow run |
| `flow_run_version` | the state version of the current flow run |
| `flow_run_name` | the name of the current flow run |
| `task_id` | the id of the current task |
| `task_run_id` | the id of the current task run |
| `task_run_version` | the state version of the current task run |

Users can also provide values to context at runtime. For more information, see the [Context concept doc](https://docs.prefect.io/core/concepts/execution.html#context).
 ## Context
 <div class='class-sig' id='prefect-utilities-context-context'><p class="prefect-sig">class </p><p class="prefect-class">prefect.utilities.context.Context</p>(*args, **kwargs)<span class="source"><a href="https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect/blob/master/src/prefect/utilities/context.py#L66">[source]</a></span></div>

A thread safe context store for Prefect data.

The `Context` is a `DotDict` subclass, and can be instantiated the same way.

**Args**:     <ul class="args"><li class="args">`*args (Any)`: arguments to provide to the `DotDict` constructor (e.g.,         an initial dictionary)     </li><li class="args">`**kwargs (Any)`: any key / value pairs to initialize this context with</li></ul>
