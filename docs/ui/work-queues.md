# Work Queues

[Work Queues](/concepts/work-queues/) and agents work together to bridge your orchestration environment &mdash; a local Prefect API server or Prefect Cloud &mdash; and your execution environments. Work queues gather flow runs for scheduled deployments, and agents pick up work from their configured work queues.

Work queue configuration lets you specify which queues handle which flow runs. You can filter runs based on tags, flow runners, and even specific deployments.

You can create, edit, manage, and delete work queues through the Prefect API server, Prefect Cloud UI, or [Prefect CLI commands](/concepts/work-queues/#work-queue-configuration).

## Managing work queues

To manage work queues in the UI, click the **Work Queues** icon. This displays a list of currently configured work queues.

You can also pause a work queue from this page by using the toggle.

Select the **+** button to create a new work queue. You'll be able to specify the details for work served by this queue.

!!! note "Work queue settings are filters"
    Note that work queue settings for Tags, Deployments, and Flow Runners are filters and restrict the work queue to servicing flow runs only for deployments that meet the filtering criteria. For example, if you do not specify any tags or deployments, the work queue will serve any flow runs. However, if you added a "test" tag to the Tags list, the work queue would serve _only_ flow runs configured with a "test" tag.

    Selecting all or none of the flow runners is functionally equivalent, but selecting any subset of flow runners restricts the work queue to flow runs configured to use those flow runners.

See the [Work Queues and Agents](/concepts/work-queues/) documentation for details on configuring work queues.

Click on the name of any work queue to see details about it.

You can also pause a work queue from this page by using the toggle.

The commands button enables you to edit or delete the work queue.
