# Organizations in Prefect Cloud

For larger teams, and companies with more complex needs around user and access management, [annual plans](https://www.prefect.io/pricing) include _organizations_ in Prefect Cloud 2. Organizations provide a host of ways to collaborate securely at scale, including:

- Organizational accounts and membership management
- [Role Based Access Controls (RBAC)](/ui/roles/) to set user permissions at organization and workspace levels
- Service accounts to generate credentials for specific workloads
- Expanded and customizable [Flow Run Retention Policy](/ui/flow-runs/#flow-run-retention-policy)

Control granular access to workspaces by setting default access for all organization members, inviting specific members to collaborate in an organization workspace, or adding service account permissions.
