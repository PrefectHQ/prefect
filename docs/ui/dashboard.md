# Flow Runs

The **Flow Runs** page provides high-level visibility into the status of your flow and task runs. From the dashboard, you can filter results to explore specific run states, scheduled runs, and more. You can drill down into details about: 

- Flows
- Deployments
- Flow runs

When a Prefect API server is running, you can access the UI at [http://127.0.0.1:4200](http://127.0.0.1:4200). If you're running a local server or accessing a server running in a container or cluster, the default initial view is the dashboard.
