title: CI/CD With Prefect
---

Many organizations deploy Prefect workflows via their CI/CD process. Each organization has their own unique CI/CD setup, but a common pattern is to use CI/CD to manage Prefect [deployments](https://docs.prefect.io/concepts/deployments). Combining Prefect's deployment features with CI/CD tools enables efficient management of flow code updates, scheduling changes, and container builds. This guide uses [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) to implement a CI/CD process, but these concepts are generally applicable across many CI/CD tools.

Note that Prefect's primary ways for creating deployments, a `.deploy` flow method or a `prefect.yaml` configuration file, are both designed with building and pushing images to a Docker registry in mind.

Getting started with GitHub Actions and Prefect
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this example, you'll write a GitHub Actions workflow that will run each time you push to your repository's `main` branch. This workflow will build and push a Docker image containing your flow code to Docker Hub, then deploy the flow to Prefect Cloud.

### Repository secrets

Your CI/CD process must be able to authenticate with Prefect in order to deploy flows.

Deploying flows securely and non-interactively in your CI/CD process can be accomplished by saving your `PREFECT_API_URL` and `PREFECT_API_KEY` [as secrets in your repository's settings](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions) so they can be accessed in your CI/CD runner's environment without exposing them in any scripts or configuration files.

In this scenario, deploying flows involves building and pushing Docker images, so add `DOCKER_USERNAME` and `DOCKER_PASSWORD` as secrets to your repository as well.

You can create secrets for GitHub Actions in your repository under **Settings -> Secrets and variables -> Actions -> New repository secret**:

### Writing a GitHub workflow

To deploy your flow via GitHub Actions, you'll need a workflow YAML file. GitHub will look for workflow YAML files in the `.github/workflows/` directory in the root of your repository. In their simplest form, GitHub workflow files are made up of triggers and jobs.

The `on:` trigger is set to run the workflow each time a push occurs on the `main` branch of the repository.

The `deploy` job is comprised of four `steps`:

*   **`Checkout`** clones your repository into the GitHub Actions runner so you can reference files or run scripts from your repository in later steps.
*   **`Log in to Docker Hub`** authenticates to DockerHub so your image can be pushed to the Docker registry in your DockerHub account. [docker/login-action](https://github.com/docker/login-action) is an existing GitHub action maintained by Docker. `with:` passes values into the Action, similar to passing parameters to a function.
*   **`Setup Python`** installs your selected version of Python.
*   **`Prefect Deploy`** installs the dependencies used in your flow, then deploys your flow. `env:` makes the `PREFECT_API_KEY` and `PREFECT_API_URL` secrets from your repository available as environment variables during this step's execution.

### Running a GitHub workflow

After pushing commits to your repository, GitHub will automatically trigger a run of your workflow. The status of running and completed workflows can be monitored from the **Actions** tab of your repository.

![A GitHub Action triggered via push](/images/ci-cd1.png)

You can view the logs from each workflow step as they run. The `Prefect Deploy` step will include output about your image build and push, and the creation/update of your deployment.

```

```


Advanced example
-------------------------------------------------------

In more complex scenarios, CI/CD processes often need to accommodate several additional considerations to enable a smooth development workflow:

*   Making code available in different environments as it advances through stages of development
*   Handling independent deployment of distinct groupings of work, as in a monorepo
*   Efficiently using build time to avoid repeated work

This [example repository](https://github.com/prefecthq/cicd-example-workspaces) demonstrates how each of these considerations can be addressed using a combination of Prefect's and GitHub's capabilities.

### Deploying to multiple workspaces

Which deployment processes should run are automatically selected when changes are pushed depending on two conditions:

```
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - stg
      - main
    paths:
      - "project_1/**"

```


1.  **`branches:`** - which branch has changed. This will ultimately select which Prefect workspace a deployment is created or updated in. In this example, changes on the `stg` branch will deploy flows to a staging workspace, and changes on the `main` branch will deploy flows to a production workspace.
2.  **`paths:`** - which project folders' files have changed. Since each project folder contains its own flows, dependencies, and `prefect.yaml`, it represents a complete set of logic and configuration that can be deployed independently. Each project in this repository gets its own GitHub Actions workflow YAML file.

The `prefect.yaml` file in each project folder depends on environment variables that are dictated by the selected job in each CI/CD workflow, enabling external code storage for Prefect deployments that is clearly separated across projects and environments.

```
  .
  ├── cicd-example-workspaces-prod  # production bucket
  │   ├── project_1
  │   └── project_2
  └── cicd-example-workspaces-stg  # staging bucket
      ├── project_1
      └── project_2  

```


Since the deployments in this example use S3 for code storage, it's important that push steps place flow files in separate locations depending upon their respective environment and project so no deployment overwrites another deployment's files.

### Caching build dependencies

Since building Docker images and installing Python dependencies are essential parts of the deployment process, it's useful to rely on caching to skip repeated build steps.

The `setup-python` action offers [caching options](https://github.com/actions/setup-python#caching-packages-dependencies) so Python packages do not have to be downloaded on repeat workflow runs.

```
- name: Setup Python
  uses: actions/setup-python@v5
  with:
    python-version: "3.11"
    cache: "pip"

```


```
Using cached prefect-2.16.1-py3-none-any.whl (2.9 MB)
Using cached prefect_aws-0.4.10-py3-none-any.whl (61 kB)

```


The `build-push-action` for building Docker images also offers [caching options for GitHub Actions](https://docs.docker.com/build/cache/backends/gha/). If you are not using GitHub, other remote [cache backends](https://docs.docker.com/build/cache/backends/) are available as well.

```
- name: Build and push
  id: build-docker-image
  env:
      GITHUB_SHA: ${{ steps.get-commit-hash.outputs.COMMIT_HASH }}
  uses: docker/build-push-action@v5
  with:
    context: ${{ env.PROJECT_NAME }}/
    push: true
    tags: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}/${{ env.PROJECT_NAME }}:${{ env.GITHUB_SHA }}-stg
    cache-from: type=gha
    cache-to: type=gha,mode=max

```


```
importing cache manifest from gha:***
DONE 0.1s

[internal] load build context
transferring context: 70B done
DONE 0.0s

[2/3] COPY requirements.txt requirements.txt

[3/3] RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

```


Prefect GitHub Actions
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Prefect provides its own GitHub Actions for [authentication](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/actions-prefect-auth) and [deployment creation](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/actions-prefect-deploy). These actions can simplify deploying with CI/CD when using `prefect.yaml`, especially in cases where a repository contains flows that are used in multiple deployments across multiple Prefect Cloud workspaces.

Here's an example of integrating these actions into the workflow we created above:

```
name: Deploy Prefect flow

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  deploy:
    name: Deploy
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Log in to Docker Hub
        uses: docker/login-action@v3
        with:
          username: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}
          password: ${{ secrets.DOCKER_PASSWORD }}

      - name: Setup Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with:
          python-version: "3.11"

      - name: Prefect Auth
        uses: PrefectHQ/actions-prefect-auth@v1
        with:
          prefect-api-key: ${{ secrets.PREFECT_API_KEY }}
          prefect-workspace: ${{ secrets.PREFECT_WORKSPACE }}

      - name: Run Prefect Deploy
        uses: PrefectHQ/actions-prefect-deploy@v3
        with:
          deployment-names: my-deployment
          requirements-file-paths: requirements.txt

```


Authenticating to other Docker image registries
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The `docker/login-action` GitHub Action supports pushing images to a wide variety of image registries.

For example, if you are storing Docker images in AWS Elastic Container Registry, you can add your ECR registry URL to the `registry` key in the `with:` part of the action and use an `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` as your `username` and `password`.

```
- name: Login to ECR
  uses: docker/login-action@v3
  with:
    registry: <aws-account-number>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com
    username: ${{ secrets.AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID }}
    password: ${{ secrets.AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY }}

```
