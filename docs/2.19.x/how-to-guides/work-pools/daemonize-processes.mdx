When running workflow applications, it can be helpful to create long-running processes that run at startup and are robust to failure. In this guide you'll learn how to set up a systemd service to create long-running Prefect processes that poll for scheduled flow runs.

A systemd service is ideal for running a long-lived process on a Linux VM or physical Linux server. We will leverage systemd and see how to automatically start a [Prefect worker](https://docs.prefect.io/concepts/work-pools/#worker-overview) or long-lived [`serve` process](https://docs.prefect.io/concepts/flows/#serving-a-flow) when Linux starts. This approach provides resilience by automatically restarting the process if it crashes.

In this guide we will:

*   Create a Linux user
*   Install and configure Prefect
*   Set up a systemd service for the Prefect worker or `.serve` process

Prerequisites
-------------------------------------------------

*   An environment with a linux operating system with [systemd](https://systemd.io/) and Python 3.8 or later.
*   A superuser account (you can run `sudo` commands).
*   A Prefect Cloud account, or a local instance of a Prefect server running on your network.
*   If daemonizing a worker, you'll need a Prefect [deployment](https://docs.prefect.io/concepts/deployments/) with a [work pool](https://docs.prefect.io/concepts/work-pools/) your worker can connect to.

If using an [AWS t2-micro EC2 instance](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/t2/) with an AWS Linux image, you can install Python and pip with `sudo yum install -y python3 python3-pip`.

Step 1: Add a user
----------------------------------------------------------

Create a user account on your linux system for the Prefect process. While you can run a worker or serve process as root, it's good security practice to avoid doing so unless you are sure you need to.

In a terminal, run:

```
sudo useradd -m prefect
sudo passwd prefect

```


When prompted, enter a password for the `prefect` account.

Next, log in to the `prefect` account by running:

Step 2: Install Prefect
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Run:

This guide assumes you are installing Prefect globally, not in a virtual environment. If running a systemd service in a virtual environment, you'll just need to change the ExecPath. For example, if using [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html), change the ExecPath to target the `prefect` application in the `bin` subdirectory of your virtual environment.

Next, set up your environment so that the Prefect client will know which server to connect to.

If connecting to Prefect Cloud, follow [the instructions](https://docs.prefect.io/ui/cloud-getting-started/#create-an-api-key) to obtain an API key and then run the following:

```
prefect cloud login -k YOUR_API_KEY

```


When prompted, choose the Prefect workspace you'd like to log in to.

If connecting to a self-hosted Prefect server instance instead of Prefect Cloud, run the following and substitute the IP address of your server:

```
prefect config set PREFECT_API_URL=http://your-prefect-server-IP:4200

```


Finally, run the `exit` command to sign out of the `prefect` Linux account. This command switches you back to your sudo-enabled account so you will can run the commands in the next section.

Step 3: Set up a systemd service
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

See the section below if you are setting up a Prefect worker. Skip to the [next section](#setting-up-a-systemd-service-for-serve) if you are setting up a Prefect `.serve` process.

### Setting up a systemd service for a Prefect worker

Move into the `/etc/systemd/system` folder and open a file for editing. We use the Vim text editor below.

```
cd /etc/systemd/system
sudo vim my-prefect-service.service

```


my-prefect-service.service

```
[Unit]
Description=Prefect worker

[Service]
User=prefect
WorkingDirectory=/home
ExecStart=prefect worker start --pool YOUR_WORK_POOL_NAME
Restart=always

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

```


Make sure you substitute your own work pool name.

### Setting up a systemd service for `.serve`

Copy your flow entrypoint Python file and any other files needed for your flow to run into the `/home` directory (or the directory of your choice).

Here's a basic example flow:


```python my_file.py

from prefect import flow


@flow(log_prints=True)
def say_hi():
    print("Hello!")

if __name__=="__main__":
    say_hi.serve(name="Greeting from daemonized .serve")

```


If you want to make changes to your flow code without restarting your process, you can push your code to git-based cloud storage (GitHub, BitBucket, GitLab) and use `flow.from_source().serve()`, as in the example below.


```python my_remote_flow_code_file.py
if __name__ == "__main__":
flow.from_source(
    source="https://github.com/org/repo.git",
    entrypoint="path/to/my_remote_flow_code_file.py:say_hi",
).serve(name="deployment-with-github-storage")

```


Make sure you substitute your own flow code entrypoint path.

Note that if you change the flow entrypoint parameters, you will need to restart the process.

Move into the `/etc/systemd/system` folder and open a file for editing. We use the Vim text editor below.

```
cd /etc/systemd/system
sudo vim my-prefect-service.service

```



```python my-prefect-service.service

[Unit]
Description=Prefect serve 

[Service]
User=prefect
WorkingDirectory=/home
ExecStart=python3 my_file.py
Restart=always

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

```


Save, enable, and start the service
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To save the file and exit Vim hit the escape key, type `:wq!`, then press the return key.

Next, run `sudo systemctl daemon-reload` to make systemd aware of your new service.

Then, run `sudo systemctl enable my-prefect-service` to enable the service. This command will ensure it runs when your system boots.

Next, run `sudo systemctl start my-prefect-service` to start the service.

Run your deployment from UI and check out the logs on the **Flow Runs** page.

You can see if your daemonized Prefect worker or serve process is running and see the Prefect logs with `systemctl status my-prefect-service`.

That's it! You now have a systemd service that starts when your system boots, and will restart if it ever crashes.

Next steps
-------------------------------------------

If you want to set up a long-lived process on a Windows machine the pattern is similar. Instead of systemd, you can use [NSSM](https://nssm.cc/).
