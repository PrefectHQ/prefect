title: Object-Level Access Control Lists
---

Prefect Cloud's [Custom plan](https://www.prefect.io/pricing) offers object-level access control lists to restrict access to specific users and service accounts within a workspace. ACLs are supported for blocks and deployments.

Organization Admins and Workspace Owners can configure access control lists by navigating to an object and clicking **manage access**. When an ACL is added, all users and service accounts with access to an object via their workspace role will lose access if not explicitly added to the ACL.

<Note>
**ACLs and visibility**
</Note>

Objects not governed by access control lists such as flow runs, flows, and artifacts will be visible to a user within a workspace even if an associated block or deployment has been restricted for that user.

See the [Prefect Cloud plans](https://www.prefect.io/pricing) to learn more about options for supporting object-level access control.
