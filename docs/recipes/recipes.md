# Prefect Recipes

[Prefect recipes](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect-recipes) are common, extensible examples for setting up Prefect in your execution environment with ready-made ingredients such as Dockerfiles, Terraform files, and GitHub Actions.

Recipes are useful when you are looking for tutorials on how to deploy an agent, use event-driven flows, set up unit testing, and more.

The following are Prefect recipes specific to Prefect 2. You can find a full repository of recipes at [https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect-recipes](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect-recipes) and additional recipes at [Prefect Discourse](https://discourse.prefect.io/).

### Contributing recipes

We're always looking for new recipe contributions! See the [Prefect Recipes](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect-recipes#contributing--swag-) repository for details on how you can add your Prefect 2 recipe, share flow best practices with fellow Prefect users, and earn some swag.
