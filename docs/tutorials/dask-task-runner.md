# Dask integration

Prefect integrates with `Dask` via the [task runner interface](/concepts/task-runners/). 
The [DaskTaskRunner](/api-ref/prefect/task-runners.md#prefect.task_runners.DaskTaskRunner) runs Prefect
tasks using [Dask's Distributed
Scheduler](https://distributed.dask.org/en/latest/). It can be used locally on
a single machine, but is most useful when scaling out distributed across multiple
nodes.


## Modes

Prefect's `DaskTaskRunner` has 3 operating modes:

- Using a local cluster
- Using a temporary cluster
- Connecting to an existing cluster

### Using a local cluster

By default, when you use a `DaskTaskRunner` it creates a temporary local Dask
cluster.

```python
from prefect import flow
from prefect.task_runners import DaskTaskRunner

# By default this will use a temporary local Dask cluster
@flow(task_runner=DaskTaskRunner())
def my_flow():
    pass
```

The number of workers used is based on the number of cores on your machine. The
default should provide a mix of processes and threads that should work well for
most workloads. If you want to specify this explicitly, you can pass
`n_workers` or `threads_per_worker` to `cluster_kwargs`.

```python
# Use 4 worker processes, each with 2 threads
DaskTaskRunner(
    cluster_kwargs={"n_workers": 4, "threads_per_worker": 2}
)
```

### Using a temporary cluster

The `DaskTaskRunner` is capable of creating a temporary cluster using any of
[Dask's cluster-manager options](https://docs.dask.org/en/latest/setup.html).
This can be useful when you want each flow run to have its own Dask cluster,
allowing for adaptive scaling per-flow.

To configure, you need to provide a `cluster_class`. This can be either a
string specifying the import path to the cluster class (e.g.
`"dask_cloudprovider.aws.FargateCluster"`), the cluster class itself, or a
function for creating a custom cluster. You can also configure
`cluster_kwargs`, which takes a dictionary of keyword arguments to pass to
`cluster_class` when starting the flow run.

For example, to configure a flow to use a temporary
`dask_cloudprovider.aws.FargateCluster` with 4 workers running with an image
named `my-prefect-image`:

```python
DaskTaskRunner(
    cluster_class="dask_cloudprovider.aws.FargateCluster",
    cluster_kwargs={"n_workers": 4, "image": "my-prefect-image"},
)
```

#### Adaptive scaling

One nice feature of using a `DaskTaskRunner` is the ability to scale adaptively
to the workload. Instead of specifying `n_workers` as a fixed number, this lets
you specify a minimum and maximum number of workers to use, and the dask
cluster will scale up and down as needed.

To do this, you can pass `adapt_kwargs` to `DaskTaskRunner`. This takes the
following fields:

- `maximum` (`int` or `None`, optional): the maximum number of workers to scale
  to. Set to `None` for no maximum.
- `minimum` (`int` or `None`, optional): the minimum number of workers to scale
  to. Set to `None` for no minimum.

For example, here we configure a flow to run on a `FargateCluster` scaling up
to at most 10 workers.

```python
DaskTaskRunner(
    cluster_class="dask_cloudprovider.aws.FargateCluster",
    adapt_kwargs={"maximum": 10}
)
```

### Connecting to an existing cluster

Multiple Prefect flow runs can all use the same existing Dask cluster. You
might manage a single long-running Dask cluster (maybe using the [Helm
Chart](https://docs.dask.org/en/latest/setup/kubernetes-helm.html)) and
configure flows to connect to it during execution. This has a few downsides
when compared to using a temporary cluster (as described above):

- All workers in the cluster must have dependencies installed for all flows you
  intend to run.

- Multiple flow runs may compete for resources. Dask tries to do a good job
  sharing resources between tasks, but you may still run into issues.

That said, you may prefer managing a single long running cluster. To configure
a `DaskTaskRunner` to connect to an existing cluster, pass in the address of the
scheduler to the `address` argument:

```python
# Connect to an existing cluster running at a specified address
DaskTaskRunner(address="tcp://...")
```

## Annotations

Dask annotations can be used to further control the behavior of tasks.

For example, we can set the [priority](http://distributed.dask.org/en/stable/priority.html) of tasks in the Dask scheduler:

```python
import dask
from prefect import flow, task
from prefect.task_runners import DaskTaskRunner

@task
def show(x):
    print(x)


@flow(task_runner=DaskTaskRunner())
def my_flow():
    with dask.annotate(priority=-10):
        future = show(1)  # low priority task

    with dask.annotate(priority=10):
        future = show(2)  # high priority task
```

Another common use-case is [resource](http://distributed.dask.org/en/stable/resources.html) annotations:

```python
import dask
from prefect import flow, task
from prefect.task_runners import DaskTaskRunner

@task
def show(x):
    print(x)

# Create a `LocalCluster` with some resource annotations
# Annotations are abstract in dask and not inferred from your system.
# Here, we claim that our system has 1 GPU and 1 process available per worker
@flow(
    task_runner=DaskTaskRunner(
        cluster_kwargs={"n_workers": 1, "resources": {"GPU": 1, "process": 1}}
    )
)
def my_flow():
    with dask.annotate(resources={'GPU': 1}):
        future = show(0)  # this task requires 1 GPU resource on a worker

    with dask.annotate(resources={'process': 1}):
        # These tasks each require 1 process on a worker; because we've 
        # specified that our cluster has 1 process per worker and 1 worker,
        # these tasks will run sequentially
        future = show(1)
        future = show(2)
        future = show(3)
```
