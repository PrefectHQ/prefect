## 3.0.3 - Cache Rules Everything Around Me

*Released on September 20, 2024*

This release introduces improvements to cache policy configuration, offering developers more control and flexibility in managing task result caching:

- Customizable Storage Location: Specify where cache entries are stored using the `key_storage` parameter.
- Configurable Isolation Level: Set the isolation level for cache access with the `isolation_level` parameter.
- Locking Mechanism: Implement concurrent access control using the `lock_manager` parameter.

These enhancements allow for more sophisticated caching strategies, improving performance and resource management in complex workflows.

## 3.0.1 - The Director's Cut

*Released on September 06, 2024*

This release contains a large collection of relatively small improvements and bug fixes on the back of our major 3.0.0 release.  One particular set of improvements that I'd like to focus on are enhancements to server side logging and event handling.  We received [a few reports](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect/issues/15153) of task run states not showing up in the UI/API.  It's important to note that events - and now task run states! - require a websocket connection to the API (the good news is that this will _not_ disrupt workflow execution).  Websockets are sometimes blocked by default in firewalls and network configuration, so we are working to raise failures to establish such a connection more prominently and potentially allow for alternative configurations.  If you notice any issues with this, [please let us know](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect/issues/new/choose)!
