## 3.2.0 - Param-a-lama-ding-dong

*Released on February 08, 2025*

This release contains a lot! In particular, users can now specify parameters on a per-schedule basis. This is useful for flows with multiple schedules, for example:

```python
from prefect import flow
from prefect.schedules import Cron

@flow
def send_email(to: str, message: str = "Stop goofing off!"):
    print(f"Sending email to {to} with message: {message}")

send_email.serve(
  name="my-flow",
  schedules=[
    Cron(
      "0 8 * * *",
      parameters={"to": "jim.halpert@dundermifflin.com"}
    ),
    Cron(
      "5 8 * * *",
      parameters={
        "to": "dwight.schrute@dundermifflin.com",
        "message": "Stop goofing off! You're assistant _to_ the regional manager!"
      }
    )
  ]
)
```
