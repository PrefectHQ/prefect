## 0.5.15

_Released on August 26, 2025_

This release fixes a bug where `prefect-aws` depended on `mypy_boto3_sqs` unnecessarily and caused an error on start up.

## 0.5.14

_Released on August 26, 2025_

This release introduces significant improvements to ECS worker management and observability. The new `prefect-aws` CLI simplifies ECS worker deployment with commands to deploy and manage ECS workers using CloudFormation templates.

Additionally, event replication capabilities have been added to the ECS worker, enabling real-time monitoring of ECS task state changes through SQS and EventBridge. This creates a foundation for more stateless ECS worker operations and ensures events aren't lost if workers go down during flow execution.

See the [ECS worker documentation](/integrations/prefect-aws/ecs-worker#with-the-prefect-aws-cli) for CLI usage examples and deployment guides.
