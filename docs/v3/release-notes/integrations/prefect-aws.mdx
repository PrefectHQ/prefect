## 0.6.0

_Released on October 14, 2025_

With this release the ECS worker now uses an event-based architecture that receives task state changes via EventBridge and SQS, replacing the previous polling-based design. This dramatically improves crash detection responsiveness and reduces API overhead. The worker gracefully degrades to limited functionality if SQS is unavailable, ensuring continued operation even during infrastructure issues.

See the [ECS worker documentation](/integrations/prefect-aws/ecs-worker) for setup instructions.

**Features**

- Move ECS worker to event-based crash detection [#18804](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect/pull/18804) by [@desertaxle](https://github.com/desertaxle)

## 0.5.16

_Released on August 27, 2025_

**Bug Fixes**

- Fix exposed typing imports and remove start signal for observer to avoid the ECS worker hanging on start up [#18798](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect/pull/18798) by [@desertaxle](https://github.com/desertaxle)

## 0.5.15

_Released on August 26, 2025_

This release fixes a bug where `prefect-aws` depended on `mypy_boto3_sqs` unnecessarily and caused an error on start up.

## 0.5.14

_Released on August 26, 2025_

This release introduces significant improvements to ECS worker management and observability. The new `prefect-aws` CLI simplifies ECS worker deployment with commands to deploy and manage ECS workers using CloudFormation templates.

Additionally, event replication capabilities have been added to the ECS worker, enabling real-time monitoring of ECS task state changes through SQS and EventBridge. This creates a foundation for more stateless ECS worker operations and ensures events aren't lost if workers go down during flow execution.

See the [ECS worker documentation](/integrations/prefect-aws/ecs-worker#with-the-prefect-aws-cli) for CLI usage examples and deployment guides.

**Features**

- Add event replication to `ECSWorker` [#18681](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect/pull/18681) by [@desertaxle](https://github.com/desertaxle)
- Add `prefect-aws` Docker images [#18750](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect/pull/18750) by [@desertaxle](https://github.com/desertaxle)
- Add CDK stacks for ECS worker infrastructure [#18755](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect/pull/18755) by [@desertaxle](https://github.com/desertaxle)
- Add `prefect-aws` CLI for ECS worker management [#18771](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect/pull/18771) by [@desertaxle](https://github.com/desertaxle)
