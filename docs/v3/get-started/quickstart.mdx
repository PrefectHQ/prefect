In this tutorial you'll create and orchestrate our first workflow--by defining what code should run, where and when it should execute, and how to handle failures.

You'll need to install the package `prefect-cloud` into a virtual environment on your machine. This tutorial uses `uv`, a modern Python package manager, to do this. To get started, run the following commands in your terminal. 

```python
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh # Installs `uv`.
uv venv && source .venv/bin/activate # Create and activate a virtual environment.
uv pip install prefect-cloud # Install `prefect-cloud` into your virtual environment.
```





It's best practice to use a virtual environment, so we'll first use `uv` to create one and then activate it.

```python
uv venv && source .venv/bin/activate
```

Now that we're in our activated virtual environment, we'll install `prefect-cloud`. 

```python
uv pip install prefect-cloud
```



```python
uv run prefect-cloud deploy 01_getting_started.py:main \
--from https://github.com/PrefectHQ/quickstart
```

```python
uv run prefect-cloud run main/main
```

```python
uv run prefect-cloud schedule main/main "0 8 * * *"
```
