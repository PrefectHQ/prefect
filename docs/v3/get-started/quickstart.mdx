import Installation from '/snippets/installation.mdx'

Prefect is an orchestration and observability platform that empowers developers to build and scale workflows quickly.
In this quickstart, you will use Prefect to convert the following Python script to a deployable workflow.

```python my_script.py
import httpx


def show_stars(github_repos: list[str]):
    """Show the number of stars that GitHub repos have"""

    for repo in github_repos:
        repo_stats = fetch_stats(repo)
        stars = get_stars(repo_stats)
        print(f"{repo}: {stars} stars")


def fetch_stats(github_repo: str):
    """Fetch the statistics for a GitHub repo"""

    return httpx.get(f"https://api.github.com/repos/{github_repo}").json()


def get_stars(repo_stats: dict):
    """Get the number of stars from GitHub repo statistics"""

    return repo_stats['stargazers_count']


if __name__ == "__main__":
    show_stars([
        "PrefectHQ/prefect",
        "pydantic/pydantic",
        "huggingface/transformers"
    ])
```

## Install Prefect

<Installation />

<Tip>
See [Install Prefect](/v3/get-started/install/) for more details on installation.
</Tip>

## Connect to a Prefect API

Connect to a Prefect API:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Self-hosted">
1. Start a local API server:

   ```bash
   prefect server start
   ```

1. Open the Prefect dashboard in your browser at [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200).
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Prefect Cloud">
1. Head to [https://app.prefect.cloud/](https://app.prefect.cloud/) and sign in or create a free Prefect Cloud account.
1. Log in to Prefect Cloud from your development environment:

   ```bash
   prefect cloud login
   ```

1. Choose **Log in with a web browser** and click the **Authorize** button in the browser window that opens.

Your CLI is now authenticated with your Prefect Cloud account through a locally stored API key that expires in 30 days.

If you have any issues with browser-based authentication, you can [authenticate with a manually created API key](/v3/manage/cloud/manage-users/api-keys/) instead.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Convert your script to a Prefect workflow

Decorators are the easiest way to convert a Python script into a workflow.

1. Add a `@flow` decorator to the script's entrypoint.
1. Add `@task` decorators to any methods called by the flow.

This will create a [flow](/v3/develop/write-flows/) and corresponding [tasks](/v3/develop/write-tasks/). 
Tasks receive metadata about upstream dependencies and the state of those dependencies before they run.
Prefect records these dependencies and states as it orchestrates these tasks.

```python my_workflow.py
import httpx

from prefect import flow, task # Prefect flow and task decorators


@flow(log_prints=True)
def show_stars(github_repos: list[str]):
    """Flow: Show the number of stars that GitHub repos have"""

    for repo in github_repos:
        # Call Task 1
        repo_stats = fetch_stats(repo)

        # Call Task 2
        stars = get_stars(repo_stats)

        # Print the result
        print(f"{repo}: {stars} stars")


@task
def fetch_stats(github_repo: str):
    """Task 1: Fetch the statistics for a GitHub repo"""

    return httpx.get(f"https://api.github.com/repos/{github_repo}").json()


@task
def get_stars(repo_stats: dict):
    """Task 2: Get the number of stars from GitHub repo statistics"""

    return repo_stats['stargazers_count']


# Run the flow
if __name__ == "__main__":
    show_stars([
        "PrefectHQ/prefect",
        "pydantic/pydantic",
        "huggingface/transformers"
    ])
```

<Note>
The `log_prints=True` argument provided to the `@flow` decorator automatically converts any `print` statements within the function to `INFO` level logs.
</Note>

## Run your flow

You can run your Prefect flow just as you would a Python script:

```bash
python my_workflow.py
```

The output in your terminal should look similar to this:

```bash
08:21:31.335 | INFO    | prefect.engine - Created flow run 'attentive-kestrel' for flow 'show-stars'
08:21:31.336 | INFO    | prefect.engine - View at http://127.0.0.1:4200/runs/flow-run/edf6866f-371d-4e51-a9e3-556a525b1146

08:21:31.775 | INFO    | Task run 'get_stars-585' - Finished in state Completed()
08:21:31.776 | INFO    | Flow run 'attentive-kestrel' - PrefectHQ/prefect: 17318 stars
08:21:32.089 | INFO    | Task run 'fetch_stats-e16' - Finished in state Completed()
08:21:32.118 | INFO    | Task run 'get_stars-756' - Finished in state Completed()
08:21:32.119 | INFO    | Flow run 'attentive-kestrel' - pydantic/pydantic: 186318 stars
08:21:32.409 | INFO    | Task run 'fetch_stats-b62' - Finished in state Completed()
08:21:32.440 | INFO    | Task run 'get_stars-8ad' - Finished in state Completed()
08:21:32.441 | INFO    | Flow run 'attentive-kestrel' - huggingface/transformers: 134848 stars
08:21:32.469 | INFO    | Flow run 'attentive-kestrel' - Finished in state Completed()
```

Prefect automatically tracks the state of the flow run and logs the output, which can be viewed directly in the terminal or in the UI.

## Next steps

In this tutorial, you successfully converted a Python script to a deployable workflow tracked by Prefect.

Next, get this workflow off of your laptop and [run it automatically on a schedule](/v3/tutorials/schedule).
