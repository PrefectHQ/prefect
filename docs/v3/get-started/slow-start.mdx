Welcome to the Slow Start - a curated learning path for those who want to go deeper than the quick start and are willing to take the time to learn Prefect thoroughly.

Unlike the quickstart which gets you running immediately, this guide provides a narrative, concrete use-case driven approach to understanding Prefect's architecture and capabilities.

## Why Slow Start?

The quickstart is great for getting up and running quickly, but sometimes you want to understand the **why** behind the **what**. This guide walks you through Prefect step-by-step, building understanding layer by layer.

## The Journey

<Steps>
  <Step title="Look! It's Just Normal Python">
    **Goal**: Understand that Prefect flows are just Python functions with observability.
    
    ### Core Concepts
    - Your Python function remains your Python function
    - `@flow` decorator adds monitoring, tracing, and logging
    - No magic - you can still call your function normally
    
    ### What You'll Learn
    - How to convert existing Python code to Prefect flows
    - Understanding state handling and lifecycle hooks
    - Observability features out of the box
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Prefect Architecture">
    **Goal**: Understand the relationship between client-side code and server-side orchestration.
    
    ### Core Concepts
    - **Work Pools**: Define possible infrastructure configurations
    - **Deployments**: Tell the server where and how to run your flows
    - **Workers**: Execute deployments by pulling work from pools
    
    ### Key Understanding
    > Work pools define possible infra config, server knows where and how to run deployments
    
    ### What You'll Learn
    - Creating work pools
    - Making deployments
    - Spinning up workers
    - How the server coordinates execution
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Deploy the Normal Python">
    **Goal**: Take your Python code from local to production.
    
    ### Core Concepts
    - Dependency management (requirements.txt, pyproject.toml)
    - Caching for performance and memoization
    - Resiliency patterns (retries, exception handling)
    
    ### Understanding the Layers
    Your Python function sits at the center of multiple layers that Prefect provides:
    
    1. **Resiliency**: Handles function retry on exceptions
    2. **Caching**: Manages result persistence and retrieval
    3. **Dependency Management**: Ensures upstream work completes before starting
    4. **State Handling**: Manages workflow execution and lifecycle hooks
    5. **Observability**: Provides monitoring, tracing, and logging
    
    Each layer enhances your code without modifying its core logic. Execution flows inward through each layer, while results and exceptions flow outward.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Storage / CI/CD">
    **Goal**: Integrate Prefect with your existing development workflow.
    
    ### Core Concepts
    - GitHub Actions (GHA) integration
    - Job variables and work pool modifications
    - Storage backends for code and results
    
    ### What You'll Learn
    - Setting up CI/CD pipelines for deployments
    - Managing configuration across environments
    - Best practices for production deployments
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Scaling: N Developers, 1 Docker Worker on VM">
    **Goal**: Understand how to scale from single developer to team.
    
    ### Core Concepts
    - Single worker serving multiple developers
    - systemd (or any daemon manager) for process management
    - Resource allocation and scheduling
    
    ### What You'll Learn
    - Setting up shared infrastructure
    - Managing concurrent executions
    - Monitoring and debugging in multi-user environments
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Next Steps

After completing the Slow Start, you'll have:
- Deep understanding of Prefect's architecture
- Production-ready deployment patterns
- Scalable infrastructure setup
- Integration with existing tools and workflows

This foundation prepares you to explore advanced features like:
- Event-driven automation
- Complex dependency graphs
- Custom infrastructure blocks
- Advanced scheduling patterns
