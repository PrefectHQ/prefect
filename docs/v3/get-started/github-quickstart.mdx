Using the `prefect-cloud` CLI, you can deploy any Python script that's available in a GitHub repository and run it on a schedule in the cloud for free in a few simple steps.

### Prerequisites
You'll need the following to get started with Prefect Cloud:
- [A free Prefect Cloud account](https://app.prefect.cloud/auth/sign-in)
- [A free GitHub account](https://github.com/signup)
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) installed on your system

Next, open a terminal and execute the commands in the following steps to deploy and run your script in Prefect Cloud.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Log in to Prefect Cloud">
    ```bash
    uvx prefect-cloud login
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect to GitHub">
    ```bash
    uvx prefect-cloud github setup
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deploy your workflow">
    Select a function in your script as the **entrypoint** for your workflow, and provide the path to it from the root of your repository.
    Your entrypoint should be the "main" function of your script â€” the function that's called first when you run your script locally.

    ```bash
    uvx prefect-cloud deploy <path/to/script.py:entrypoint_function_name> \
        --from <github-account>/<repo-name> \
        --name <deployment_name>
    ```

    `prefect-cloud deploy` has a few helpful options, like adding Python dependencies to your deployment and setting the default parameter values for your entrypoint function.

    <AccordionGroup>
      <Accordion title="Add dependencies">
        Add individual Python dependencies by including their package name.
        ```bash
        uvx prefect-cloud deploy ... --with pandas --with numpy
        ```
        
        Include dependencies from a requirements file by providing the path to the file from the root of your repository.
        ```
        uvx prefect-cloud deploy ... --with-requirements </path/to/requirements.txt>
        ```
      </Accordion>

      <Accordion title="Set parameter defaults">
        If your entrypoint function has parameters, you can assign the default values used by your deployment.
        
        ```python
        def hello(name: str, company: str):
            print(f"Hello {name}, welcome to {company}!")
        ```

        ```bash
        uvx prefect-cloud deploy ... --parameter name=Kevin --parameter company=Prefect
        ```
        </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="Include environment variables">
        Include key-value pairs that will be available as environment variables when your deployment runs.
        ```bash
        uvx prefect-cloud deploy ... --env KEY=VALUE --env KEY2=VALUE2
        ```
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="Include secrets">
        Store secrets in Secret Prefect [blocks](/v3/concepts/blocks) that will be loaded as environment variables by name reference when your deployment runs.
        Blocks are encrypted, helping avoid storing secret values as plaintext properties on your deployment.
        ```bash
        uvx prefect-cloud deploy ... --secret API_KEY=actual-secret-value --secret DB_PASSWORD=another-secret-value
        ```

        Reference existing Secret blocks by name.
        ```bash
        uvx prefect-cloud deploy ... --secret API_KEY="{existing-api-key-block}" --secret DB_PASSWORD="{my-database-password}"
        ```
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="Select Python version">
        Select the version of Python to run your script on.
        Supported Python versions include `3.9`, `3.10`, `3.11`, and `3.12`.
        ```bash
        uvx prefect-cloud deploy ... --with-python 3.12
        ```
      </Accordion>
    </AccordionGroup>

    If you don't have a script to deploy, you can use this example:
    ```bash
    uvx prefect-cloud deploy examples/hello.py:hello_world \
        --from PrefectHQ/prefect-cloud \
        --name github_quickstart
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run your deployment">
    ```bash
    uvx prefect-cloud run <flow_name>/<deployment_name>
    ````
    <AccordionGroup>
      <Accordion title="Override parameter defaults for a single run">
        You can override the inputs to your entrypoint function for ad-hoc runs of your deployment.

        ```python
        def hello(name: str, company: str):
            print(f"Hello {name}, welcome to {company}!")
        ```
      
        ```bash
        uvx prefect-cloud run ... --parameter name=Kevin --parameter company=Prefect
        ```

      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="Follow run output in your terminal">
      Tail your run's state changes and log outputs directly in your terminal.

      ```bash
      uvx prefect-cloud run ... --follow
      ```
      </Accordion>
    </AccordionGroup>

    If using the example script, run:
    ```bash
    uvx prefect-cloud run hello_world/github_quickstart
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Schedule your deployment">
    Prefect Cloud can run your deployment on a schedule if you provide a [cron expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron) like `0 * * * *` for hourly runs or `0 0 * * *` for daily runs at midnight.
    ```bash
    uvx prefect-cloud schedule <flow_name>/<deployment_name> <SCHEDULE>
    ````

    <AccordionGroup>
      <Accordion title="Set per-schedule parameter defaults">
        Prefect deployments can have multiple schedules, each with their own default parameter values.

        ```python
        def check_restaurant_reservations(restaurant: str):
            opentable_api_tables_checker(restaurant)
        ```
        ```bash
        # Hawksmoor reservations update at 12pm
        uvx prefect-cloud schedule ... "0 12 * * *" --parameter restaurant="Hawksmoor"
        ```
        ```bash
        # Carbone reservations update at 4pm
        uvx prefect-cloud schedule ... "0 16 * * *" --parameter restaurant="Carbone" 
        ```
      </Accordion>
    </AccordionGroup>

    If using the example script, run the following command to schedule your deployment to run hourly:
    ```bash
    uvx prefect-cloud schedule hello_world/github_quickstart "0 * * * *"
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="View your runs in Prefect Cloud">
    Visit the [Prefect Cloud dashboard](https://app.prefect.cloud/auth/sign-in) to see the status of your runs.
  </Step>
</Steps>



## Cleanup

To remove schedules from your deployment, run:
```bash
uvx prefect-cloud unschedule <flow_name>/<deployment_name>
```

To delete a deployment, run:
```bash
uvx prefect-cloud delete <flow_name>/<deployment_name>
```

## Next steps

Prefect offers much more than simple code deployment and scheduling.
Install the `prefect` Python package in your development environment, and explore the following topics:

- Divide your work into [observable units](/v3/how-to-guides/workflows/write-and-run) with flows and tasks.
- Automatically rerun workflows on failure with [retries](/v3/how-to-guides/workflows/retries).
- Checkpoint workflow progress and skip reruns of completed work with [caching](/v3/concepts/caching).
- [Run work concurrently](/v3/how-to-guides/workflows/run-work-concurrently) using `.submit()` and `.map()`.
- Build a data lineage graph by [materializing assets](/v3/how-to-guides/workflows/assets).
- [Version your deployments](/v3/how-to-guides/deployments/versioning) and roll back to working versions when they fail.
- Run flows on your own infrastructure in custom [work pools](/v3/concepts/work-pools).
