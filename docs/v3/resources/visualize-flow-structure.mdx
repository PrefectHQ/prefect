title: Visualize flow structure
description: Learn how to view the overall structure of your flow.
---

Quickly view the structure of your flow using its `visualize()` method. 
Calling this method attempts to produce a schematic diagram of your flow and tasks without 
actually running your flow code.

<Warning>
Functions and code outside of flows or tasks will still be run when calling 
`visualize()`. This may have unintended consequences. Place your code into tasks to 
avoid unintended 
execution.
</Warning>

To use the `visualize()` method, you must havae Graphviz installed and on your PATH. 
Please install Graphviz from [http://www.graphviz.org/download/](http://www.graphviz.org/download/). 

<Note>
Just installing the `graphviz` python package is not sufficient.
</Note>

```python
from prefect import flow, task

@task(name="Print Hello")
def print_hello(name):
    msg = f"Hello {name}!"
    print(msg)
    return msg

@task(name="Print Hello Again")
def print_hello_again(name):
    msg = f"Hello {name}!"
    print(msg)
    return msg

@flow(name="Hello Flow")
def hello_world(name="world"):
    message = print_hello(name)
    message2 = print_hello_again(message)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    hello_world.visualize()
```

Prefect cannot automatically produce a schematic for dynamic workflows, such as those with loops or 
if/else control flow.
In this case, you can provide tasks with mock return values for use in the `visualize()` call.

```python
from prefect import flow, task
@task(viz_return_value=[4])
def get_list():
    return [1, 2, 3]

@task
def append_one(n):
    return n.append(6)

@flow
def viz_return_value_tracked():
    l = get_list()
    for num in range(3):
        l.append(5)
        append_one(l)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    viz_return_value_tracked.visualize()
```
