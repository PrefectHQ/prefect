## `prefect flow-run retry`



```command
prefect flow-run retry [OPTIONS] ID_OR_NAME

<Info>
Retry a failed or completed flow run.

The flow run can be specified by either its UUID or its name. If multiple
flow runs have the same name, you must use the UUID to disambiguate.

If the flow run has an associated deployment, it will be scheduled for retry
and a worker will pick it up. If there is no deployment, you must provide
an --entrypoint to the flow code, and the flow will execute locally.

Examples:
    \$ prefect flow-run retry abc123-def456-7890-...
    \$ prefect flow-run retry my-flow-run-name
    \$ prefect flow-run retry abc123 --entrypoint ./flows/my_flow.py:my_flow
