## `prefect flow-runs retry`



```command
prefect flow-runs retry [OPTIONS] ID_OR_NAME

Retry a failed or completed flow run.

If the flow run has an associated deployment, it will be scheduled for retry
and a worker will pick it up. If there is no deployment, you must provide
an --entrypoint to the flow code, and the flow will execute locally.

Examples:
    \$ prefect flow-run retry abc123-def456-7890-...
    \$ prefect flow-run retry my-flow-run-name
