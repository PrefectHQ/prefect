### `RecentDeploymentsScheduler` <sup><a href="https://github.com/prefecthq/prefect/blob/main/src/prefect/server/services/scheduler.py#L305" target="_blank">↗</a></sup>


Schedules deployments that were updated very recently

This scheduler can run on a tight loop and ensure that runs from
newly-created or updated deployments are rapidly scheduled without having to
wait for the "main" scheduler to complete its loop.

Note that scheduling is idempotent, so its ok for this scheduler to attempt
to schedule the same deployments as the main scheduler. It's purpose is to
accelerate scheduling for any deployments that users are interacting with.


**Methods:**
