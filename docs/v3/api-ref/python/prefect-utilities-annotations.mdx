# `prefect.utilities.annotations`

## Classes

### `BaseAnnotation`


Base class for Prefect annotation types.

Inherits from `tuple` for unpacking support in other tools.


**Methods:**

#### `unwrap`

```python
unwrap(self) -> T
```

#### `rewrap`

```python
rewrap(self, value: T) -> Self
```

### `unmapped`


Wrapper for iterables.

Indicates that this input should be sent as-is to all runs created during a mapping
operation instead of being split.


### `allow_failure`


Wrapper for states or futures.

Indicates that the upstream run for this input can be failed.

Generally, Prefect will not allow a downstream run to start if any of its inputs
are failed. This annotation allows you to opt into receiving a failed input
downstream.

If the input is from a failed run, the attached exception will be passed to your
function.


### `quote`


Simple wrapper to mark an expression as a different type so it will not be coerced
by Prefect. For example, if you want to return a state from a flow without having
the flow assume that state.

quote will also instruct prefect to ignore introspection of the wrapped object
when passed as flow or task parameter. Parameter introspection can be a
significant performance hit when the object is a large collection,
e.g. a large dictionary or DataFrame, and each element needs to be visited. This
will disable task dependency tracking for the wrapped object, but likely will
increase performance.

```
@task
def my_task(df):
    ...

@flow
def my_flow():
    my_task(quote(df))
```


**Methods:**

#### `unquote`

```python
unquote(self) -> T
```

### `Quote`

### `NotSet`


Singleton to distinguish `None` from a value that is not provided by the user.


### `freeze`


Wrapper for parameters in deployments.

Indicates that this parameter should be frozen in the UI and not editable
when creating flow runs from this deployment.

Example:
```python
@flow
def my_flow(customer_id: str):
    # flow logic

deployment = my_flow.deploy(parameters={"customer_id": freeze("customer123")})
```


**Methods:**

#### `unfreeze`

```python
unfreeze(self) -> T
```

Return the unwrapped value.
