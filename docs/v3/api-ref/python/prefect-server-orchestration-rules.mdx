# `prefect.server.orchestration.rules`



Prefect's flow and task-run orchestration machinery.

This module contains all the core concepts necessary to implement Prefect's state
orchestration engine. These states correspond to intuitive descriptions of all the
points that a Prefect flow or task can observe executing user code and intervene, if
necessary. A detailed description of states can be found in our concept
[documentation](/concepts/states).

Prefect's orchestration engine operates under the assumption that no governed user code
will execute without first requesting Prefect REST API validate a change in state and record
metadata about the run. With all attempts to run user code being checked against a
Prefect instance, the Prefect REST API database becomes the unambiguous source of truth for managing
the execution of complex interacting workflows. Orchestration rules can be implemented
as discrete units of logic that operate against each state transition and can be fully
observable, extensible, and customizable -- all without needing to store or parse a
single line of user code.


## Classes

### `OrchestrationContext` <sup><a href="https://github.com/prefecthq/prefect/blob/main/src/prefect/server/orchestration/rules.py#L72" target="_blank">↗</a></sup>


A container for a state transition, governed by orchestration rules.

When a flow- or task- run attempts to change state, Prefect REST API has an opportunity
to decide whether this transition can proceed. All the relevant information
associated with the state transition is stored in an `OrchestrationContext`,
which is subsequently governed by nested orchestration rules implemented using
the `BaseOrchestrationRule` ABC.

`OrchestrationContext` introduces the concept of a state being `None` in the
context of an intended state transition. An initial state can be `None` if a run
is is attempting to set a state for the first time. The proposed state might be
`None` if a rule governing the transition determines that no state change
should occur at all and nothing is written to the database.

**Args:**
- `session`: a SQLAlchemy database session
- `initial_state`: the initial state of a run
- `proposed_state`: the proposed state a run is transitioning into


**Methods:**

#### `initial_state_type` <sup><a href="https://github.com/prefecthq/prefect/blob/main/src/prefect/server/orchestration/rules.py#L126" target="_blank">↗</a></sup>

```python
initial_state_type(self) -> Optional[states.StateType]
```

The state type of `self.initial_state` if it exists.


#### `proposed_state_type` <sup><a href="https://github.com/prefecthq/prefect/blob/main/src/prefect/server/orchestration/rules.py#L132" target="_blank">↗</a></sup>

```python
proposed_state_type(self) -> Optional[states.StateType]
```

The state type of `self.proposed_state` if it exists.


#### `validated_state_type` <sup><a href="https://github.com/prefecthq/prefect/blob/main/src/prefect/server/orchestration/rules.py#L138" target="_blank">↗</a></sup>

```python
validated_state_type(self) -> Optional[states.StateType]
```

The state type of `self.validated_state` if it exists.


#### `run_settings` <sup><a href="https://github.com/prefecthq/prefect/blob/main/src/prefect/server/orchestration/rules.py#L143" target="_blank">↗</a></sup>

```python
run_settings(self) -> RP
```

Run-level settings used to orchestrate the state transition.


#### `safe_copy` <sup><a href="https://github.com/prefecthq/prefect/blob/main/src/prefect/server/orchestration/rules.py#L149" target="_blank">↗</a></sup>

```python
safe_copy(self) -> Self
```

Creates a mostly-mutation-safe copy for use in orchestration rules.

Orchestration rules govern state transitions using information stored in
an `OrchestrationContext`. However, mutating objects stored on the context
directly can have unintended side-effects. To guard against this,
`self.safe_copy` can be used to pass information to orchestration rules
without risking mutation.

**Returns:**
- A mutation-safe copy of the `OrchestrationContext`


#### `entry_context` <sup><a href="https://github.com/prefecthq/prefect/blob/main/src/prefect/server/orchestration/rules.py#L177" target="_blank">↗</a></sup>

```python
entry_context(self) -> tuple[Optional[states.State], Optional[states.State], Self]
```

A convenience method that generates input parameters for orchestration rules.

An `OrchestrationContext` defines a state transition that is managed by
orchestration rules which can fire hooks before a transition has been committed
to the database. These hooks have a consistent interface which can be generated
with this method.


#### `exit_context` <sup><a href="https://github.com/prefecthq/prefect/blob/main/src/prefect/server/orchestration/rules.py#L192" target="_blank">↗</a></sup>

```python
exit_context(self) -> tuple[Optional[states.State], Optional[states.State], Self]
```

A convenience method that generates input parameters for orchestration rules.

An `OrchestrationContext` defines a state transition that is managed by
orchestration rules which can fire hooks after a transition has been committed
to the database. These hooks have a consistent interface which can be generated
with this method.


### `FlowOrchestrationContext` <sup><a href="https://github.com/prefecthq/prefect/blob/main/src/prefect/server/orchestration/rules.py#L211" target="_blank">↗</a></sup>


A container for a flow run state transition, governed by orchestration rules.

When a flow- run attempts to change state, Prefect REST API has an opportunity
to decide whether this transition can proceed. All the relevant information
associated with the state transition is stored in an `OrchestrationContext`,

`FlowOrchestrationContext` introduces the concept of a state being `None` in the
context of an intended state transition. An initial state can be `None` if a run
is is attempting to set a state for the first time. The proposed state might be
`None` if a rule governing the transition determines that no state change
should occur at all and nothing is written to the database.

**Args:**
- `session`: a SQLAlchemy database session

### `BaseOrchestrationRule` <sup><a href="https://github.com/prefecthq/prefect/blob/main/src/prefect/server/orchestration/rules.py#L534" target="_blank">↗</a></sup>


An abstract base class used to implement a discrete piece of orchestration logic.

An `OrchestrationRule` is a stateful context manager that directly governs a state
transition. Complex orchestration is achieved by nesting multiple rules.
Each rule runs against an `OrchestrationContext` that contains the transition
details; this context is then passed to subsequent rules. The context can be
modified by hooks that fire before and after a new state is validated and committed
to the database. These hooks will fire as long as the state transition is
considered "valid" and govern a transition by either modifying the proposed state
before it is validated or by producing a side-effect.

A state transition occurs whenever a flow- or task- run changes state, prompting
Prefect REST API to decide whether or not this transition can proceed. The current state of
the run is referred to as the "initial state", and the state a run is
attempting to transition into is the "proposed state". Together, the initial state
transitioning into the proposed state is the intended transition that is governed
by these orchestration rules. After using rules to enter a runtime context, the
`OrchestrationContext` will contain a proposed state that has been governed by
each rule, and at that point can validate the proposed state and commit it to
the database. The validated state will be set on the context as
`context.validated_state`, and rules will call the `self.after_transition` hook
upon exiting the managed context.

Examples:

    Create a rule:

    >>> class BasicRule(BaseOrchestrationRule):
    >>>     # allowed initial state types
    >>>     FROM_STATES = [StateType.RUNNING]
    >>>     # allowed proposed state types
    >>>     TO_STATES = [StateType.COMPLETED, StateType.FAILED]
    >>>
    >>>     async def before_transition(initial_state, proposed_state, ctx):
    >>>         # side effects and proposed state mutation can happen here
    >>>         ...
    >>>
    >>>     async def after_transition(initial_state, validated_state, ctx):
    >>>         # operations on states that have been validated can happen here
    >>>         ...
    >>>
    >>>     async def cleanup(intitial_state, validated_state, ctx):
    >>>         # reverts side effects generated by `before_transition` if necessary
    >>>         ...

    Use a rule:

    >>> intended_transition = (StateType.RUNNING, StateType.COMPLETED)
    >>> async with BasicRule(context, *intended_transition):
    >>>     # context.proposed_state has been governed by BasicRule
    >>>     ...

    Use multiple rules:

    >>> rules = [BasicRule, BasicRule]
    >>> intended_transition = (StateType.RUNNING, StateType.COMPLETED)
    >>> async with contextlib.AsyncExitStack() as stack:
    >>>     for rule in rules:
    >>>         stack.enter_async_context(rule(context, *intended_transition))
    >>>
    >>>     # context.proposed_state has been governed by all rules
    >>>     ...

**Args:**
- `context`: A `FlowOrchestrationContext` or `TaskOrchestrationContext` that is
passed between rules
- `from_state_type`: The state type of the initial state of a run, if this
state type is not contained in `FROM_STATES`, no hooks will fire
- `to_state_type`: The state type of the proposed state before orchestration, if
this state type is not contained in `TO_STATES`, no hooks will fire


### `FlowRunOrchestrationRule` <sup><a href="https://github.com/prefecthq/prefect/blob/main/src/prefect/server/orchestration/rules.py#L945" target="_blank">↗</a></sup>

### `TaskRunOrchestrationRule` <sup><a href="https://github.com/prefecthq/prefect/blob/main/src/prefect/server/orchestration/rules.py#L951" target="_blank">↗</a></sup>

### `GenericOrchestrationRule` <sup><a href="https://github.com/prefecthq/prefect/blob/main/src/prefect/server/orchestration/rules.py#L957" target="_blank">↗</a></sup>

### `BaseUniversalTransform` <sup><a href="https://github.com/prefecthq/prefect/blob/main/src/prefect/server/orchestration/rules.py#L963" target="_blank">↗</a></sup>


An abstract base class used to implement privileged bookkeeping logic.

Beyond the orchestration rules implemented with the `BaseOrchestrationRule` ABC,
Universal transforms are not stateful, and fire their before- and after- transition
hooks on every state transition unless the proposed state is `None`, indicating that
no state should be written to the database. Because there are no guardrails in place
to prevent directly mutating state or other parts of the orchestration context,
universal transforms should only be used with care.

**Args:**
- `context`: A `FlowOrchestrationContext` or `TaskOrchestrationContext` that is
passed between transforms


**Methods:**

#### `nullified_transition` <sup><a href="https://github.com/prefecthq/prefect/blob/main/src/prefect/server/orchestration/rules.py#L1060" target="_blank">↗</a></sup>

```python
nullified_transition(self) -> bool
```

Determines if the transition has been nullified.

Transitions are nullified if the proposed state is `None`, indicating that
nothing should be written to the database.

**Returns:**
- True if the transition is nullified, False otherwise.


#### `exception_in_transition` <sup><a href="https://github.com/prefecthq/prefect/blob/main/src/prefect/server/orchestration/rules.py#L1073" target="_blank">↗</a></sup>

```python
exception_in_transition(self) -> bool
```

Determines if the transition has encountered an exception.

**Returns:**
- True if the transition is encountered an exception, False otherwise.
