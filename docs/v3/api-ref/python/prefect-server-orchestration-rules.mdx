# `prefect.server.orchestration.rules`



Prefect's flow and task-run orchestration machinery.

This module contains all the core concepts necessary to implement Prefect's state
orchestration engine. These states correspond to intuitive descriptions of all the
points that a Prefect flow or task can observe executing user code and intervene, if
necessary. A detailed description of states can be found in our concept
[documentation](https://docs.prefect.io/v3/concepts/states).

Prefect's orchestration engine operates under the assumption that no governed user code
will execute without first requesting Prefect REST API validate a change in state and record
metadata about the run. With all attempts to run user code being checked against a
Prefect instance, the Prefect REST API database becomes the unambiguous source of truth for managing
the execution of complex interacting workflows. Orchestration rules can be implemented
as discrete units of logic that operate against each state transition and can be fully
observable, extensible, and customizable -- all without needing to store or parse a
single line of user code.


## Classes

### `OrchestrationContext` <sup><a href="https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect/blob/main/src/prefect/server/orchestration/rules.py#L71" target="_blank"><Icon icon="github" style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" /></a></sup>


A container for a state transition, governed by orchestration rules.

When a flow- or task- run attempts to change state, Prefect REST API has an opportunity
to decide whether this transition can proceed. All the relevant information
associated with the state transition is stored in an `OrchestrationContext`,
which is subsequently governed by nested orchestration rules implemented using
the `BaseOrchestrationRule` ABC.

`OrchestrationContext` introduces the concept of a state being `None` in the
context of an intended state transition. An initial state can be `None` if a run
is is attempting to set a state for the first time. The proposed state might be
`None` if a rule governing the transition determines that no state change
should occur at all and nothing is written to the database.

**Args:**
- `session`: a SQLAlchemy database session
- `initial_state`: the initial state of a run
- `proposed_state`: the proposed state a run is transitioning into


**Methods:**

#### `entry_context` <sup><a href="https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect/blob/main/src/prefect/server/orchestration/rules.py#L177" target="_blank"><Icon icon="github" style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" /></a></sup>

```python
entry_context(self) -> tuple[Optional[states.State], Optional[states.State], Self]
```

A convenience method that generates input parameters for orchestration rules.

An `OrchestrationContext` defines a state transition that is managed by
orchestration rules which can fire hooks before a transition has been committed
to the database. These hooks have a consistent interface which can be generated
with this method.


#### `exit_context` <sup><a href="https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect/blob/main/src/prefect/server/orchestration/rules.py#L192" target="_blank"><Icon icon="github" style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" /></a></sup>

```python
exit_context(self) -> tuple[Optional[states.State], Optional[states.State], Self]
```

A convenience method that generates input parameters for orchestration rules.

An `OrchestrationContext` defines a state transition that is managed by
orchestration rules which can fire hooks after a transition has been committed
to the database. These hooks have a consistent interface which can be generated
with this method.


#### `flow_run` <sup><a href="https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect/blob/main/src/prefect/server/orchestration/rules.py#L207" target="_blank"><Icon icon="github" style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" /></a></sup>

```

Reset the fields of the model that are in the `_reset_fields` set.

**Returns:**
- A new instance of the model with the reset fields.


#### `run_settings` <sup><a href="https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect/blob/main/src/prefect/server/orchestration/rules.py#L143" target="_blank"><Icon icon="github" style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" /></a></sup>

```python
safe_copy(self) -> Self
```

Creates a mostly-mutation-safe copy for use in orchestration rules.

Orchestration rules govern state transitions using information stored in
an `OrchestrationContext`. However, mutating objects stored on the context
directly can have unintended side-effects. To guard against this,
`self.safe_copy` can be used to pass information to orchestration rules
without risking mutation.

**Returns:**
- A mutation-safe copy of the `OrchestrationContext`


#### `validated_state_type` <sup><a href="https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect/blob/main/src/prefect/server/orchestration/rules.py#L138" target="_blank"><Icon icon="github" style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" /></a></sup>

validated_state_type(self) -> Optional[states.StateType]
```

The state type of `self.validated_state` if it exists.


### `FlowOrchestrationContext` <sup><a href="https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect/blob/main/src/prefect/server/orchestration/rules.py#L211" target="_blank"><Icon icon="github" style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" /></a></sup>

`self.safe_copy` can be used to pass information to orchestration rules
without risking mutation.

**Returns:**
- A mutation-safe copy of `FlowOrchestrationContext`


#### `task_run` <sup><a href="https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect/blob/main/src/prefect/server/orchestration/rules.py#L361" target="_blank"><Icon icon="github" style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" /></a></sup>

```python
validate_proposed_state(self, db: PrefectDBInterface)
```

Validates a proposed state by committing it to the database.

After the `FlowOrchestrationContext` is governed by orchestration rules, the
proposed state can be validated: the proposed state is added to the current
SQLAlchemy session and is flushed. `self.validated_state` set to the flushed
state. The state on the run is set to the validated state as well.

If the proposed state is `None` when this method is called, no state will be
written and `self.validated_state` will be set to the run's current state.

**Returns:**
- None


### `TaskOrchestrationContext` <sup><a href="https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect/blob/main/src/prefect/server/orchestration/rules.py#L368" target="_blank"><Icon icon="github" style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" /></a></sup>


A container for a task run state transition, governed by orchestration rules.

to decide whether this transition can proceed. All the relevant information
associated with the state transition is stored in an `OrchestrationContext`,
which is subsequently governed by nested orchestration rules implemented using
the `BaseOrchestrationRule` ABC.

`TaskOrchestrationContext` introduces the concept of a state being `None` in the
context of an intended state transition. An initial state can be `None` if a run
is is attempting to set a state for the first time. The proposed state might be
`None` if a rule governing the transition determines that no state change
should occur at all and nothing is written to the database.

```python
validate_proposed_state(self, db: PrefectDBInterface)
```

Validates a proposed state by committing it to the database.

After the `TaskOrchestrationContext` is governed by orchestration rules, the
proposed state can be validated: the proposed state is added to the current
SQLAlchemy session and is flushed. `self.validated_state` set to the flushed
state. The state on the run is set to the validated state as well.

If the proposed state is `None` when this method is called, no state will be
written and `self.validated_state` will be set to the run's current state.

**Returns:**
- None


### `BaseOrchestrationRule` <sup><a href="https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect/blob/main/src/prefect/server/orchestration/rules.py#L534" target="_blank"><Icon icon="github" style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" /></a></sup>


An abstract base class used to implement a discrete piece of orchestration logic.

An `OrchestrationRule` is a stateful context manager that directly governs a state
transition. Complex orchestration is achieved by nesting multiple rules.
Each rule runs against an `OrchestrationContext` that contains the transition
details; this context is then passed to subsequent rules. The context can be
modified by hooks that fire before and after a new state is validated and committed
to the database. These hooks will fire as long as the state transition is
considered "valid" and govern a transition by either modifying the proposed state
before it is validated or by producing a side-effect.

A state transition occurs whenever a flow- or task- run changes state, prompting
Prefect REST API to decide whether or not this transition can proceed. The current state of
the run is referred to as the "initial state", and the state a run is
attempting to transition into is the "proposed state". Together, the initial state
transitioning into the proposed state is the intended transition that is governed
by these orchestration rules. After using rules to enter a runtime context, the
`OrchestrationContext` will contain a proposed state that has been governed by
each rule, and at that point can validate the proposed state and commit it to
the database. The validated state will be set on the context as
`context.validated_state`, and rules will call the `self.after_transition` hook
upon exiting the managed context.

Examples:

    Create a rule:

    ```python
    class BasicRule(BaseOrchestrationRule):
        # allowed initial state types
        FROM_STATES = [StateType.RUNNING]
        # allowed proposed state types
        TO_STATES = [StateType.COMPLETED, StateType.FAILED]

        async def before_transition(initial_state, proposed_state, ctx):
            # side effects and proposed state mutation can happen here
            ...

        async def after_transition(initial_state, validated_state, ctx):
            # operations on states that have been validated can happen here
            ...

        async def cleanup(intitial_state, validated_state, ctx):
            # reverts side effects generated by `before_transition` if necessary
            ...
    ```

    Use a rule:

    ```python
    intended_transition = (StateType.RUNNING, StateType.COMPLETED)
    async with BasicRule(context, *intended_transition):
        # context.proposed_state has been governed by BasicRule
        ...
    ```

    Use multiple rules:

    ```python
    rules = [BasicRule, BasicRule]
    intended_transition = (StateType.RUNNING, StateType.COMPLETED)
    async with contextlib.AsyncExitStack() as stack:
        for rule in rules:
            stack.enter_async_context(rule(context, *intended_transition))

        # context.proposed_state has been governed by all rules
        ...
    ```

**Args:**
- `context`: A `FlowOrchestrationContext` or `TaskOrchestrationContext` that is
passed between rules
- `from_state_type`: The state type of the initial state of a run, if this
state type is not contained in `FROM_STATES`, no hooks will fire
- `to_state_type`: The state type of the proposed state before orchestration, if
this state type is not contained in `TO_STATES`, no hooks will fire


**Methods:**

#### `abort_transition` <sup><a href="https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect/blob/main/src/prefect/server/orchestration/rules.py#L900" target="_blank"><Icon icon="github" style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" /></a></sup>

```python
abort_transition(self, reason: str) -> None
```

Aborts a proposed transition before the transition is validated.

This method will abort a proposed transition, expecting no further action to
occur for this run. The proposed state is set to `None`, signaling to the
`OrchestrationContext` that no state should be written to the database. A
reason for aborting the transition is also provided. Rules that abort the
transition will not fizzle, despite the proposed state type changing.

**Args:**
- `reason`: The reason for aborting the transition


#### `after_transition` <sup><a href="https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect/blob/main/src/prefect/server/orchestration/rules.py#L727" target="_blank"><Icon icon="github" style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" /></a></sup>

```python
after_transition(self, initial_state: Optional[states.State], validated_state: Optional[states.State], context: OrchestrationContext[T, RP]) -> None
```

Implements a hook that can fire after a state is committed to the database.

**Args:**
- `initial_state`: The initial state of a transition
- `validated_state`: The governed state that has been committed to the database
- `context`: A safe copy of the `OrchestrationContext`, with the exception of
`context.run`, mutating this context will have no effect on the broader
orchestration environment.

**Returns:**
- None


#### `before_transition` <sup><a href="https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect/blob/main/src/prefect/server/orchestration/rules.py#L696" target="_blank"><Icon icon="github" style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" /></a></sup>

```python
before_transition(self, initial_state: Optional[states.State], proposed_state: Optional[states.State], context: OrchestrationContext[T, RP]) -> None
```

Implements a hook that can fire before a state is committed to the database.

This hook may produce side-effects or mutate the proposed state of a
transition using one of four methods: `self.reject_transition`,
`self.delay_transition`, `self.abort_transition`, and `self.rename_state`.

**Args:**
- `initial_state`: The initial state of a transition
- `proposed_state`: The proposed state of a transition
- `context`: A safe copy of the `OrchestrationContext`, with the exception of
`context.run`, mutating this context will have no effect on the broader
orchestration environment.

**Returns:**
- None


#### `cleanup` <sup><a href="https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect/blob/main/src/prefect/server/orchestration/rules.py#L747" target="_blank"><Icon icon="github" style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" /></a></sup>

```python
cleanup(self, initial_state: Optional[states.State], validated_state: Optional[states.State], context: OrchestrationContext[T, RP]) -> None
```

Implements a hook that can fire after a state is committed to the database.

The intended use of this method is to revert side-effects produced by
`self.before_transition` when the transition is found to be invalid on exit.
This allows multiple rules to be gracefully run in sequence, without logic that
keeps track of all other rules that might govern a transition.

**Args:**
- `initial_state`: The initial state of a transition
- `validated_state`: The governed state that has been committed to the database
- `context`: A safe copy of the `OrchestrationContext`, with the exception of
`context.run`, mutating this context will have no effect on the broader
orchestration environment.

**Returns:**
- None


#### `delay_transition` <sup><a href="https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect/blob/main/src/prefect/server/orchestration/rules.py#L868" target="_blank"><Icon icon="github" style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" /></a></sup>

```python
delay_transition(self, delay_seconds: int, reason: str) -> None
```

Delays a proposed transition before the transition is validated.

This method will delay a proposed transition, setting the proposed state to
`None`, signaling to the `OrchestrationContext` that no state should be
written to the database. The number of seconds a transition should be delayed is
passed to the `OrchestrationContext`. A reason for delaying the transition is
also provided. Rules that delay the transition will not fizzle, despite the
proposed state type changing.

**Args:**
- `delay_seconds`: The number of seconds the transition should be delayed
- `reason`: The reason for delaying the transition


#### `fizzled` <sup><a href="https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect/blob/main/src/prefect/server/orchestration/rules.py#L795" target="_blank"><Icon icon="github" style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" /></a></sup>

```python
fizzled(self) -> bool
```

Determines if a rule is fizzled and side-effects need to be reverted.

Rules are fizzled if the transitions were valid on entry (thus firing
`self.before_transition`) but are invalid upon exiting the governed context,
most likely caused by another rule mutating the transition.

**Returns:**
- True if the rule is fizzled, False otherwise.


#### `invalid` <sup><a href="https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect/blob/main/src/prefect/server/orchestration/rules.py#L772" target="_blank"><Icon icon="github" style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" /></a></sup>

```python
invalid(self) -> bool
```

Determines if a rule is invalid.

Invalid rules do nothing and no hooks fire upon entering or exiting a governed
context. Rules are invalid if the transition states types are not contained in
`self.FROM_STATES` and `self.TO_STATES`, or if the context is proposing
a transition that differs from the transition the rule was instantiated with.

**Returns:**
- True if the rules in invalid, False otherwise.


#### `invalid_transition` <sup><a href="https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect/blob/main/src/prefect/server/orchestration/rules.py#L811" target="_blank"><Icon icon="github" style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" /></a></sup>

```python
invalid_transition(self) -> bool
```

Determines if the transition proposed by the `OrchestrationContext` is invalid.

If the `OrchestrationContext` is attempting to manage a transition with this
rule that differs from the transition the rule was instantiated with, the
transition is considered to be invalid. Depending on the context, a rule with an
invalid transition is either "invalid" or "fizzled".

**Returns:**
- True if the transition is invalid, False otherwise.


#### `reject_transition` <sup><a href="https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect/blob/main/src/prefect/server/orchestration/rules.py#L830" target="_blank"><Icon icon="github" style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" /></a></sup>

```python
reject_transition(self, state: Optional[states.State], reason: str) -> None
```

Rejects a proposed transition before the transition is validated.

This method will reject a proposed transition, mutating the proposed state to
the provided `state`. A reason for rejecting the transition is also passed on
to the `OrchestrationContext`. Rules that reject the transition will not fizzle,
despite the proposed state type changing.

**Args:**
- `state`: The new proposed state. If `None`, the current run state will be
returned in the result instead.
- `reason`: The reason for rejecting the transition


#### `rename_state` <sup><a href="https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect/blob/main/src/prefect/server/orchestration/rules.py#L924" target="_blank"><Icon icon="github" style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" /></a></sup>

```python
rename_state(self, state_name: str) -> None
```

Sets the "name" attribute on a proposed state.

The name of a state is an annotation intended to provide rich, human-readable
context for how a run is progressing. This method only updates the name and not
the canonical state TYPE, and will not fizzle or invalidate any other rules
that might govern this state transition.


#### `update_context_parameters` <sup><a href="https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect/blob/main/src/prefect/server/orchestration/rules.py#L936" target="_blank"><Icon icon="github" style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" /></a></sup>

```python
update_context_parameters(self, key: str, value: Any) -> None
```

Updates the "parameters" dictionary attribute with the specified key-value pair.

This mechanism streamlines the process of passing messages and information
between orchestration rules if necessary and is simpler and more ephemeral than
message-passing via the database or some other side-effect. This mechanism can
be used to break up large rules for ease of testing or comprehension, but note
that any rules coupled this way (or any other way) are no longer independent and
the order in which they appear in the orchestration policy priority will matter.


### `FlowRunOrchestrationRule` <sup><a href="https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect/blob/main/src/prefect/server/orchestration/rules.py#L951" target="_blank"><Icon icon="github" style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" /></a></sup>

### `TaskRunOrchestrationRule` <sup><a href="https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect/blob/main/src/prefect/server/orchestration/rules.py#L957" target="_blank"><Icon icon="github" style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" /></a></sup>

### `GenericOrchestrationRule` <sup><a href="https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect/blob/main/src/prefect/server/orchestration/rules.py#L963" target="_blank"><Icon icon="github" style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" /></a></sup>

### `BaseUniversalTransform` <sup><a href="https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect/blob/main/src/prefect/server/orchestration/rules.py#L969" target="_blank"><Icon icon="github" style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" /></a></sup>


An abstract base class used to implement privileged bookkeeping logic.

Beyond the orchestration rules implemented with the `BaseOrchestrationRule` ABC,
Universal transforms are not stateful, and fire their before- and after- transition
hooks on every state transition unless the proposed state is `None`, indicating that
no state should be written to the database. Because there are no guardrails in place
to prevent directly mutating state or other parts of the orchestration context,
universal transforms should only be used with care.

**Args:**
- `context`: A `FlowOrchestrationContext` or `TaskOrchestrationContext` that is
