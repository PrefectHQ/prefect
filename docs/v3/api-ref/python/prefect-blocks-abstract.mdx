## Classes

### `CredentialsBlock`


Stores credentials for an external system and exposes a client for interacting
with that system. Can also hold config that is tightly coupled to credentials
(domain, endpoint, account ID, etc.) Will often be composed with other blocks.
Parent block should rely on the client provided by a credentials block for
interacting with the corresponding external system.


**Methods:**

#### `logger`

```python
logger(self) -> LoggerOrAdapter
```

Returns a logger based on whether the CredentialsBlock
is called from within a flow or task run context.
If a run context is present, the logger property returns a run logger.
Else, it returns a default logger labeled with the class's name.

**Returns:**
- The run logger or a default logger with the class's name.


#### `get_client`

```python
get_client(self, *args: Any, **kwargs: Any) -> Any
```

Returns a client for interacting with the external system.

If a service offers various clients, this method can accept
a `client_type` keyword argument to get the desired client
within the service.


### `NotificationError`


Raised if a notification block fails to send a notification.


### `NotificationBlock`


Block that represents a resource in an external system that is able to send notifications.


**Methods:**

#### `logger`

```python
logger(self) -> LoggerOrAdapter
```

Returns a logger based on whether the NotificationBlock
is called from within a flow or task run context.
If a run context is present, the logger property returns a run logger.
Else, it returns a default logger labeled with the class's name.

**Returns:**
- The run logger or a default logger with the class's name.


#### `raise_on_failure`

```python
raise_on_failure(self) -> Generator[None, None, None]
```

Context manager that, while active, causes the block to raise errors if it
encounters a failure sending notifications.


### `JobRun`


Represents a job run in an external system. Allows waiting
for the job run's completion and fetching its results.


**Methods:**

#### `logger`

```python
logger(self) -> LoggerOrAdapter
```

Returns a logger based on whether the JobRun
is called from within a flow or task run context.
If a run context is present, the logger property returns a run logger.
Else, it returns a default logger labeled with the class's name.

**Returns:**
- The run logger or a default logger with the class's name.


### `JobBlock`


Block that represents an entity in an external service
that can trigger a long running execution.


**Methods:**

#### `logger`

```python
logger(self) -> LoggerOrAdapter
```

Returns a logger based on whether the JobBlock
is called from within a flow or task run context.
If a run context is present, the logger property returns a run logger.
Else, it returns a default logger labeled with the class's name.

**Returns:**
- The run logger or a default logger with the class's name.


### `DatabaseBlock`


An abstract block type that represents a database and
provides an interface for interacting with it.

Blocks that implement this interface have the option to accept
credentials directly via attributes or via a nested `CredentialsBlock`.

Use of a nested credentials block is recommended unless credentials
are tightly coupled to database connection configuration.

Implementing either sync or async context management on `DatabaseBlock`
implementations is recommended.


**Methods:**

#### `logger`

```python
logger(self) -> LoggerOrAdapter
```

Returns a logger based on whether the DatabaseBlock
is called from within a flow or task run context.
If a run context is present, the logger property returns a run logger.
Else, it returns a default logger labeled with the class's name.

**Returns:**
- The run logger or a default logger with the class's name.


### `ObjectStorageBlock`


Block that represents a resource in an external service that can store
objects.


**Methods:**

#### `logger`

```python
logger(self) -> LoggerOrAdapter
```

Returns a logger based on whether the ObjectStorageBlock
is called from within a flow or task run context.
If a run context is present, the logger property returns a run logger.
Else, it returns a default logger labeled with the class's name.

**Returns:**
- The run logger or a default logger with the class's name.


### `SecretBlock`


Block that represents a resource that can store and retrieve secrets.


**Methods:**

#### `logger`

```python
logger(self) -> LoggerOrAdapter
```

Returns a logger based on whether the SecretBlock
is called from within a flow or task run context.
If a run context is present, the logger property returns a run logger.
Else, it returns a default logger labeled with the class's name.

**Returns:**
- The run logger or a default logger with the class's name.
