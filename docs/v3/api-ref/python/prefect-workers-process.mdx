# `prefect.workers.process`



Module containing the Process worker used for executing flow runs as subprocesses.

To start a Process worker, run the following command:

```bash
prefect worker start --pool 'my-work-pool' --type process
```

Replace `my-work-pool` with the name of the work pool you want the worker
to poll for flow runs.

For more information about work pools and workers,
checkout out the [Prefect docs](/concepts/work-pools/).
