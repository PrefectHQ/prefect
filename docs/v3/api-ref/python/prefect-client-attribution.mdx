# `prefect.client.attribution`



Attribution context for API requests.

This module provides functions to gather attribution headers that identify
the source of API requests (flow runs, deployments, workers) for usage tracking
and rate limit debugging.


## Functions

```python
get_attribution_headers() -> dict[str, str]
```


Gather attribution headers from the current execution context.

These headers help Cloud track which flow runs, deployments, and workers
are generating API requests for usage attribution and rate limit debugging.

Headers are only included when values are available. All headers are optional.

**Returns:**
