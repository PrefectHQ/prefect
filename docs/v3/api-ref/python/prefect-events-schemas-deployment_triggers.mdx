# `prefect.events.schemas.deployment_triggers`



Schemas for defining triggers within a Prefect deployment YAML.  This is a separate
parallel hierarchy for representing triggers so that they can also include the
information necessary to create an automation.

These triggers should follow the validation rules of the main Trigger class hierarchy as
closely as possible (because otherwise users will get validation errors creating
triggers), but we can be more liberal with the defaults here to make it simpler to
create them from YAML.
