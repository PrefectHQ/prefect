# `prefect.events.schemas.deployment_triggers`



Schemas for defining triggers within a Prefect deployment YAML.  This is a separate
parallel hierarchy for representing triggers so that they can also include the
information necessary to create an automation.

These triggers should follow the validation rules of the main Trigger class hierarchy as
closely as possible (because otherwise users will get validation errors creating
triggers), but we can be more liberal with the defaults here to make it simpler to
create them from YAML.


## Classes

### `BaseDeploymentTrigger`


Base class describing a set of criteria that must be satisfied in order to trigger
an automation.


### `DeploymentEventTrigger`


A trigger that fires based on the presence or absence of events within a given
period of time.


### `DeploymentMetricTrigger`


A trigger that fires based on the results of a metric query.


### `DeploymentCompoundTrigger`


A composite trigger that requires some number of triggers to have
fired within the given time period


### `DeploymentSequenceTrigger`


A composite trigger that requires some number of triggers to have fired
within the given time period in a specific order
