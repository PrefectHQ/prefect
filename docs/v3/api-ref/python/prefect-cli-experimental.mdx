# `prefect.cli.experimental`



Experimental CLI commands.

These commands provide access to experimental features that are subject to change.


## Functions

### `diagnose` <sup><a href="https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect/blob/main/src/prefect/cli/experimental.py#L31" target="_blank"><Icon icon="github" style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" /></a></sup>

```python
diagnose()
```


Diagnose the experimental plugin system.

This command provides information about:
- Whether the plugin system is enabled
- What plugins are discoverable via entry points
- Current configuration (timeouts, allow/deny lists)

Note: This runs the plugin discovery but does not execute hooks.
Use safe mode (PREFECT_EXPERIMENTS_PLUGINS_SAFE_MODE=1) to test plugin loading
without executing hooks.
