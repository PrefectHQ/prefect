## Functions

```python
should_try_to_read_parameters(task: Task[P, R], task_run: TaskRun) -> bool
```


Determines whether a task run should read parameters from the result store.


### `create_status_server`

```python

```

## Classes

### `StopTaskWorker`


Raised when the task worker is stopped.


### `TaskWorker`


This class is responsible for serving tasks that may be executed in the background
by a task runner via the traditional engine machinery.

When `start()` is called, the task worker will open a websocket connection to a
server-side queue of scheduled task runs. When a scheduled task run is found, the
scheduled task run is submitted to the engine for execution with a minimal `EngineContext`
so that the task run can be governed by orchestration rules.

**Args:**
- `-`: A list of tasks to serve. These tasks will be submitted to the engine
when a scheduled task run is found.
- `-`: The maximum number of tasks that can be run concurrently. Defaults to 10.
Pass `None` to remove the limit.


**Methods:**

#### `client_id`

```python
client_id(self) -> str
```

#### `started_at`

```python
started_at(self) -> Optional[DateTime]
```

#### `started`

```python
started(self) -> bool
```

#### `limit`

```python
limit(self) -> Optional[int]
```

#### `current_tasks`

```python
current_tasks(self) -> Optional[int]
```

#### `available_tasks`

```python
available_tasks(self) -> Optional[int]
```

#### `handle_sigterm`

```python
handle_sigterm(self, signum: int, frame: object) -> None
```

Shuts down the task worker when a SIGTERM is received.
