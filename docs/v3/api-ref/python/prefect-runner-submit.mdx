## Functions

### `submit_to_runner` <sup><a href="https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect/blob/main/src/prefect/runner/submit.py#L136" target="_blank"><Icon icon="github" style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" /></a></sup>

```python
submit_to_runner(prefect_callable: Flow[Any, Any], parameters: dict[str, Any] | list[dict[str, Any]] | None = None, retry_failed_submissions: bool = True) -> FlowRun | list[FlowRun]
```


Submit a callable in the background via the runner webserver one or more times.

**Args:**
- `prefect_callable`: the callable to run (only flows are supported for now, but eventually tasks)
- `parameters`: keyword arguments to pass to the callable. May be a list of dictionaries where
each dictionary represents a discrete invocation of the callable
- `retry_failed_submissions`: Whether to retry failed submissions to the runner webserver.


### `wait_for_submitted_runs` <sup><a href="https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect/blob/main/src/prefect/runner/submit.py#L208" target="_blank"><Icon icon="github" style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" /></a></sup>

```python
wait_for_submitted_runs(flow_run_filter: FlowRunFilter | None = None, task_run_filter: TaskRunFilter | None = None, timeout: float | None = None, poll_interval: float = 3.0) -> uuid.UUID | None
```


Wait for completion of any provided flow runs (eventually task runs), as well as subflow runs
of the current flow run (if called from within a flow run and subflow runs exist).

**Args:**
- `flow_run_filter`: A filter to apply to the flow runs to wait for.
- `task_run_filter`: A filter to apply to the task runs to wait for. # TODO\: /task/run
- `timeout`: How long to wait for completion of all runs (seconds).
- `poll_interval`: How long to wait between polling each run's state (seconds).
