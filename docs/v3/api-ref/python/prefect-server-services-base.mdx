### `RunInAllServers`


A marker class for services that should run in all server processes, both the
web server and the standalone services process.


### `LoopService`


Loop services are relatively lightweight maintenance routines that need to run
periodically.

This class makes it straightforward to design and integrate them. Users only need to
define the `run_once` coroutine to describe the behavior of the service on each
loop.
