# `prefect.server.events.actions`



The actions consumer watches for actions that have been triggered by Automations
and carries them out.  Also includes the various concrete subtypes of Actions


## Classes

### `ActionFailed`

### `Action`


An Action that may be performed when an Automation is triggered


**Methods:**

#### `logging_context`

```python
logging_context(self, triggered_action: 'TriggeredAction') -> Dict[str, Any]
```

Common logging context for all actions


### `DoNothing`


Do nothing when an Automation is triggered


### `EmitEventAction`

### `ExternalDataAction`


Base class for Actions that require data from an external source such as
the Orchestration API


**Methods:**

#### `reason_from_response`

```python
reason_from_response(self, response: Response) -> str
```

### `JinjaTemplateAction`


Base class for Actions that use Jinja templates supplied by the user and
are rendered with a context containing data from the triggered action,
and the orchestration API.


**Methods:**

#### `validate_template`

```python
validate_template(cls, template: str, field_name: str) -> str
```

#### `templates_in_dictionary`

```python
templates_in_dictionary(cls, dict_: dict[Any, Any | dict[Any, Any]]) -> list[tuple[dict[Any, Any], dict[Any, str]]]
```

#### `instantiate_object`

```python
instantiate_object(self, model: Type[PrefectBaseModel], data: Dict[str, Any], triggered_action: 'TriggeredAction', resource: Optional['Resource'] = None) -> PrefectBaseModel
```

### `DeploymentAction`


Base class for Actions that operate on Deployments and need to infer them from
events


**Methods:**

#### `selected_deployment_requires_id`

```python
selected_deployment_requires_id(self) -> Self
```

### `DeploymentCommandAction`


Executes a command against a matching deployment


### `RunDeployment`


Runs the given deployment with the given parameters


**Methods:**

#### `validate_parameters`

```python
validate_parameters(cls, value: dict[str, Any] | None) -> dict[str, Any] | None
```

### `PauseDeployment`


Pauses the given Deployment


### `ResumeDeployment`


Resumes the given Deployment


### `FlowRunAction`


An action that operates on a flow run


### `FlowRunStateChangeAction`


Changes the state of a flow run associated with the trigger


### `ChangeFlowRunState`


Changes the state of a flow run associated with the trigger


### `CancelFlowRun`


Cancels a flow run associated with the trigger


### `SuspendFlowRun`


Suspends a flow run associated with the trigger


### `ResumeFlowRun`


Resumes a paused or suspended flow run associated with the trigger


### `CallWebhook`


Call a webhook when an Automation is triggered.


**Methods:**

#### `ensure_payload_is_a_string`

```python
ensure_payload_is_a_string(cls, value: Union[str, Dict[str, Any], None]) -> Optional[str]
```

Temporary measure while we migrate payloads from being a dictionary to
a string template.  This covers both reading from the database where values
may currently be a dictionary, as well as the API, where older versions of the
frontend may be sending a JSON object with the single `"message"` key.


#### `validate_payload_templates`

```python
validate_payload_templates(cls, value: Optional[str]) -> Optional[str]
```

Validate user-provided payload template.


### `SendNotification`


Send a notification when an Automation is triggered


**Methods:**

#### `is_valid_template`

```python
is_valid_template(cls, value: str, info: ValidationInfo) -> str
```

### `WorkPoolAction`


Base class for Actions that operate on Work Pools and need to infer them from
events


**Methods:**

#### `selected_work_pool_requires_id`

```python
selected_work_pool_requires_id(self) -> Self
```

### `WorkPoolCommandAction`

### `PauseWorkPool`


Pauses a Work Pool


### `ResumeWorkPool`


Resumes a Work Pool


### `WorkQueueAction`


Base class for Actions that operate on Work Queues and need to infer them from
events


**Methods:**

#### `selected_work_queue_requires_id`

```python
selected_work_queue_requires_id(self) -> Self
```

### `WorkQueueCommandAction`

### `PauseWorkQueue`


Pauses a Work Queue


### `ResumeWorkQueue`


Resumes a Work Queue


### `AutomationAction`


Base class for Actions that operate on Automations and need to infer them from
events


**Methods:**

#### `selected_automation_requires_id`

```python
selected_automation_requires_id(self) -> Self
```

### `AutomationCommandAction`

### `PauseAutomation`


Pauses a Work Queue


### `ResumeAutomation`


Resumes a Work Queue
