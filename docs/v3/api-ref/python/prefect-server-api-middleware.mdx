## Classes

### `CsrfMiddleware`


Middleware for CSRF protection. This middleware will check for a CSRF token
in the headers of any POST, PUT, PATCH, or DELETE request. If the token is
not present or does not match the token stored in the database for the
client, the request will be rejected with a 403 status code.
