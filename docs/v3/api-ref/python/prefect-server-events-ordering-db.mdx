## Classes

### `CausalOrdering` <sup><a href="https://github.com/prefecthq/prefect/blob/main/src/prefect/server/events/ordering/db.py#L35" target="_blank"><Icon icon="github" style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" /></a></sup>

**Methods:**

#### `event_has_been_seen` <sup><a href="https://github.com/prefecthq/prefect/blob/main/src/prefect/server/events/ordering/db.py#L45" target="_blank"><Icon icon="github" style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" /></a></sup>

```python
event_has_been_seen(self, event: Union[UUID, Event]) -> bool
```

#### `forget_follower` <sup><a href="https://github.com/prefecthq/prefect/blob/main/src/prefect/server/events/ordering/db.py#L71" target="_blank"><Icon icon="github" style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" /></a></sup>

```python
forget_follower(self, db: PrefectDBInterface, follower: ReceivedEvent) -> None
```

Forget that this event is waiting on another event to arrive


#### `get_followers` <sup><a href="https://github.com/prefecthq/prefect/blob/main/src/prefect/server/events/ordering/db.py#L86" target="_blank"><Icon icon="github" style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" /></a></sup>

```python
get_followers(self, db: PrefectDBInterface, leader: ReceivedEvent) -> List[ReceivedEvent]
```

Returns events that were waiting on this leader event to arrive


#### `get_lost_followers` <sup><a href="https://github.com/prefecthq/prefect/blob/main/src/prefect/server/events/ordering/db.py#L100" target="_blank"><Icon icon="github" style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" /></a></sup>

```python
get_lost_followers(self, db: PrefectDBInterface) -> List[ReceivedEvent]
```

Returns events that were waiting on a leader event that never arrived


#### `preceding_event_confirmed` <sup><a href="https://github.com/prefecthq/prefect/blob/main/src/prefect/server/events/ordering/db.py#L124" target="_blank"><Icon icon="github" style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" /></a></sup>

```python
preceding_event_confirmed(self, handler: event_handler, event: ReceivedEvent, depth: int = 0)
```

Events may optionally declare that they logically follow another event, so that
we can preserve important event orderings in the face of unreliable delivery and
ordering of messages from the queues.

This function keeps track of the ID of each event that this shard has successfully
processed going back to the PRECEDING_EVENT_LOOKBACK period.  If an event arrives
that must follow another one, confirm that we have recently seen and processed that
event before proceeding.

event (ReceivedEvent): The event to be processed. This object should include metadata indicating
    if and what event it follows.
depth (int, optional): The current recursion depth, used to prevent infinite recursion due to
    cyclic dependencies between events. Defaults to 0.


Raises EventArrivedEarly if the current event shouldn't be processed yet.


#### `record_event_as_seen` <sup><a href="https://github.com/prefecthq/prefect/blob/main/src/prefect/server/events/ordering/db.py#L49" target="_blank"><Icon icon="github" style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" /></a></sup>

```python
record_event_as_seen(self, event: ReceivedEvent) -> None
```

#### `record_follower` <sup><a href="https://github.com/prefecthq/prefect/blob/main/src/prefect/server/events/ordering/db.py#L53" target="_blank"><Icon icon="github" style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" /></a></sup>

```python
record_follower(self, db: PrefectDBInterface, event: ReceivedEvent) -> None
```

Remember that this event is waiting on another event to arrive
