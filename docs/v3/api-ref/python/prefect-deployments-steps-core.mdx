# `prefect.deployments.steps.core`



Core primitives for running Prefect deployment steps.

Deployment steps are YAML representations of Python functions along with their inputs.

Whenever a step is run, the following actions are taken:

- The step's inputs and block / variable references are resolved (see [the `prefect deploy` documentation](/guides/prefect-deploy/#templating-options) for more details)
- The step's function is imported; if it cannot be found, the `requires` keyword is used to install the necessary packages
- The step's function is called with the resolved inputs
- The step's output is returned and used to resolve inputs for subsequent steps
