# `prefect.blocks.core`

## Functions

### `block_schema_to_key`

```python
block_schema_to_key(schema: BlockSchema) -> str
```


Defines the unique key used to lookup the Block class for a given schema.


### `schema_extra`

```python
schema_extra(schema: dict[str, Any], model: type['Block']) -> None
```


Customizes Pydantic's schema generation feature to add blocks related information.


## Classes

### `InvalidBlockRegistration`


Raised on attempted registration of the base Block
class or a Block interface class


### `UnknownBlockType`


Raised when a block type is not found in the registry.


### `BlockNotSavedError`


Raised when a given block is not saved and an operation that requires
the block to be saved is attempted.


### `Block`


A base class for implementing a block that wraps an external service.

This class can be defined with an arbitrary set of fields and methods, and
couples business logic with data contained in an block document.
`_block_document_name`, `_block_document_id`, `_block_schema_id`, and
`_block_type_id` are reserved by Prefect as Block metadata fields, but
otherwise a Block can implement arbitrary logic. Blocks can be instantiated
without populating these metadata fields, but can only be used interactively,
not with the Prefect API.

Instead of the __init__ method, a block implementation allows the
definition of a `block_initialization` method that is called after
initialization.


**Methods:**

#### `block_initialization`

```python
block_initialization(self) -> None
```

#### `ser_model`

```python
ser_model(self, handler: SerializerFunctionWrapHandler, info: SerializationInfo) -> Any
```

#### `get_block_type_name`

```python
get_block_type_name(cls) -> str
```

#### `get_block_type_slug`

```python
get_block_type_slug(cls) -> str
```

#### `get_block_capabilities`

```python
get_block_capabilities(cls) -> FrozenSet[str]
```

Returns the block capabilities for this Block. Recursively collects all block
capabilities of all parent classes into a single frozenset.


#### `get_block_schema_version`

```python
get_block_schema_version(cls) -> str
```

#### `get_description`

```python
get_description(cls) -> Optional[str]
```

Returns the description for the current block. Attempts to parse
description from class docstring if an override is not defined.


#### `get_code_example`

```python
get_code_example(cls) -> Optional[str]
```

Returns the code example for the given block. Attempts to parse
code example from the class docstring if an override is not provided.


#### `get_block_class_from_schema`

```python
get_block_class_from_schema(cls: type[Self], schema: BlockSchema) -> type[Self]
```

Retrieve the block class implementation given a schema.


#### `get_block_class_from_key`

```python
get_block_class_from_key(cls: type[Self], key: str) -> type[Self]
```

Retrieve the block class implementation given a key.


#### `load`

```python
load(cls, name: str, validate: bool = True, client: Optional['PrefectClient'] = None) -> 'Self'
```

Retrieves data from the block document with the given name for the block type
that corresponds with the current class and returns an instantiated version of
the current class with the data stored in the block document.

If a block document for a given block type is saved with a different schema
than the current class calling `load`, a warning will be raised.

If the current class schema is a subset of the block document schema, the block
can be loaded as normal using the default `validate = True`.

If the current class schema is a superset of the block document schema, `load`
must be called with `validate` set to False to prevent a validation error. In
this case, the block attributes will default to `None` and must be set manually
and saved to a new block document before the block can be used as expected.

**Args:**
- `name`: The name or slug of the block document. A block document slug is a
string with the format &lt;block_type_slug&gt;/&lt;block_document_name&gt;
- `validate`: If False, the block document will be loaded without Pydantic
validating the block schema. This is useful if the block schema has
changed client-side since the block document referred to by `name` was saved.
- `client`: The client to use to load the block document. If not provided, the
default client will be injected.

**Raises:**
- `ValueError`: If the requested block document is not found.

**Returns:**
- An instance of the current class hydrated with the data stored in the
- block document with the specified name.

**Examples:**

Load from a Block subclass with a block document name:
```python
class Custom(Block):
    message: str

Custom(message="Hello!").save("my-custom-message")

loaded_block = Custom.load("my-custom-message")
```

Load from Block with a block document slug:
```python
class Custom(Block):
    message: str

Custom(message="Hello!").save("my-custom-message")

loaded_block = Block.load("custom/my-custom-message")
```

Migrate a block document to a new schema:
```python
# original class
class Custom(Block):
    message: str

Custom(message="Hello!").save("my-custom-message")

# Updated class with new required field
class Custom(Block):
    message: str
    number_of_ducks: int

loaded_block = Custom.load("my-custom-message", validate=False)

# Prints UserWarning about schema mismatch

loaded_block.number_of_ducks = 42

loaded_block.save("my-custom-message", overwrite=True)
```


#### `is_block_class`

```python
is_block_class(block: Any) -> TypeGuard[type['Block']]
```

#### `annotation_refers_to_block_class`

```python
annotation_refers_to_block_class(annotation: Any) -> bool
```

#### `get_block_placeholder`

```python
get_block_placeholder(self) -> str
```

Returns the block placeholder for the current block which can be used for
templating.

**Returns:**
- The block placeholder for the current block in the format
`prefect.blocks.{block_type_name}.{block_document_name}`

**Raises:**
- `BlockNotSavedError`: Raised if the block has not been saved.

If a block has not been saved, the return value will be `None`.


#### `model_json_schema`

```python
model_json_schema(cls, by_alias: bool = True, ref_template: str = '#/definitions/{model}', schema_generator: type[GenerateJsonSchema] = GenerateJsonSchema, mode: Literal['validation', 'serialization'] = 'validation') -> dict[str, Any]
```

TODO\: stop overriding this method - use GenerateSchema in ConfigDict instead?


#### `model_validate`

```python
model_validate(cls: type[Self], obj: dict[str, Any] | Any) -> Self
```

#### `model_dump`

```python
model_dump(self) -> dict[str, Any]
```
