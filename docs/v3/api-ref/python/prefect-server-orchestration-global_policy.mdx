# `prefect.server.orchestration.global_policy`



Bookkeeping logic that fires on every state transition.

For clarity, `GlobalFlowpolicy` and `GlobalTaskPolicy` contain all transition logic
implemented using [`BaseUniversalTransform`][prefect.server.orchestration.rules.BaseUniversalTransform].
None of these operations modify state, and regardless of what orchestration Prefect REST API might
enforce on a transition, the global policies contain Prefect's necessary bookkeeping.
Because these transforms record information about the validated state committed to the
state database, they should be the most deeply nested contexts in orchestration loop.


## Functions

### `COMMON_GLOBAL_TRANSFORMS`

```python
COMMON_GLOBAL_TRANSFORMS() -> list[type[BaseUniversalTransform[orm_models.Run, Union[core.FlowRunPolicy, core.TaskRunPolicy]]]]
```

## Classes

### `GlobalFlowPolicy`


Global transforms that run against flow-run-state transitions in priority order.

These transforms are intended to run immediately before and after a state transition
is validated.


**Methods:**

#### `priority`

```python
priority() -> list[Union[type[BaseUniversalTransform[orm_models.FlowRun, core.FlowRunPolicy]], type[BaseOrchestrationRule[orm_models.FlowRun, core.FlowRunPolicy]]]]
```

### `GlobalTaskPolicy`


Global transforms that run against task-run-state transitions in priority order.

These transforms are intended to run immediately before and after a state transition
is validated.


**Methods:**

#### `priority`

```python
priority() -> list[Union[type[BaseUniversalTransform[orm_models.TaskRun, core.TaskRunPolicy]], type[BaseOrchestrationRule[orm_models.TaskRun, core.TaskRunPolicy]]]]
```

### `SetRunStateType`


Updates the state type of a run on a state transition.


### `SetRunStateName`


Updates the state name of a run on a state transition.


### `SetStartTime`


Records the time a run enters a running state for the first time.


### `SetRunStateTimestamp`


Records the time a run changes states.


### `SetEndTime`


Records the time a run enters a terminal state.

With normal client usage, a run will not transition out of a terminal state.
However, it's possible to force these transitions manually via the API. While
leaving a terminal state, the end time will be unset.


### `IncrementRunTime`


Records the amount of time a run spends in the running state.


### `IncrementFlowRunCount`


Records the number of times a run enters a running state. For use with retries.


### `RemoveResumingIndicator`


Removes the indicator on a flow run that marks it as resuming.


### `IncrementTaskRunCount`


Records the number of times a run enters a running state. For use with retries.


### `SetExpectedStartTime`


Estimates the time a state is expected to start running if not set.

For scheduled states, this estimate is simply the scheduled time. For other states,
this is set to the time the proposed state was created by Prefect.


### `SetNextScheduledStartTime`


Records the scheduled time on a run.

When a run enters a scheduled state, `run.next_scheduled_start_time` is set to
the state's scheduled time. When leaving a scheduled state,
`run.next_scheduled_start_time` is unset.


### `UpdateSubflowParentTask`


Whenever a subflow changes state, it must update its parent task run's state.


### `UpdateSubflowStateDetails`


Update a child subflow state's references to a corresponding tracking task run id
in the parent flow run


### `UpdateStateDetails`


Update a state's references to a corresponding flow- or task- run.
