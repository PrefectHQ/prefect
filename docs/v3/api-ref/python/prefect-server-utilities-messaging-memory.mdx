## Classes

### `MemoryMessage`

### `Subscription`


A subscription to a topic.

Messages are delivered to the subscription's queue and retried up to a

number of retries it is moved to the dead letter queue.

The dead letter queue is a directory of JSON files containing the serialized
message.

Messages remain in the dead letter queue until they are removed manually.
