description: Self-host your own Prefect server instance with Docker.
---

You can use the official Prefect Docker image to run a server in a container.

If you're running a server in a Docker container, you need to:

- Port forward the server to your local machine (e.g. `-p 4200:4200`)
- Set the `--host` flag on the `prefect server start` command to `0.0.0.0`
- Set the API server address, `PREFECT_API_URL`, to use Prefect within a container.

For example:

```bash
docker run -p 4200:4200 -d --rm prefecthq/prefect:3-latest -- prefect server start --host 0.0.0.0
```

<Tip>
The `-d` flag runs the container in detached mode (i.e. in the background) and the `--rm` flag removes the container once it is stopped.
