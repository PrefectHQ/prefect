The [Prefect CLI](/v3/get-started/install) is the easiest way to start a local instance of Prefect server.

### Start the server

1. Spin up a self-hosted Prefect server instance UI with the `prefect server start` CLI command in the terminal:

```bash
prefect server start
```

2. Open the URL for the Prefect server UI ([http://127.0.0.1:4200](http://127.0.0.1:4200) by default) in a browser.

3. Shut down the Prefect server with ctrl  +  c in the terminal.

### Configure the server

Go to your terminal session and run this command to set the API URL to point to a self-hosted Prefect server instance:

```bash
prefect config set PREFECT_API_URL="http://127.0.0.1:4200/api"
```


You can save the API server address in a Prefect profile. 
Whenever that profile is active, the API endpoint is at that address.
See [Profiles and configuration](/v3/develop/settings-and-profiles/) for more information on profiles and configurable Prefect settings.
