## What is a flow?

Flows are defined as decorated Python functions.
They can take inputs, perform work, and return a result.
When a function becomes a flow, it gains the following capabilities:

- Metadata about [flow runs](#flow-runs), such as run time and final state, is automatically tracked.
- Each [state](/v3/concepts/states/) the flow enters is recorded. This
allows you to observe and act upon each transition in the flow's execution.
- Input arguments can be type validated as workflow [parameters](#specify-flow-parameters).
- [Retries](/v3/how-to-guides/workflows/retries) can be performed on failure, with configurable delay and retry limits.
- Timeouts can be enforced to prevent unintentional, long-running workflows.
- A flow can be [deployed](/v3/how-to-guides/deployments/create-deployments/), which exposes an API for interacting with it remotely.

Flows do not need to call other Prefect tasks or flows, but they can.


## Supported function types

Almost any standard Python function can be turned into a Prefect flow by adding the `@flow` decorator. 

In particular, Prefect supports:

- Synchronous functions
- Asynchronous functions
- Instance methods
- Class methods
- Static methods
- Generators

<Warning>
**Generator functions are consumed when returned from flows**

The result of a completed flow must be serializable, but generators cannot be serialized. 
Therefore, if you return a generator from a flow, the generator will be fully consumed and its yielded values will be returned as a list. 
This can lead to unexpected behavior or blocking if the generator is infinite or very large.

Here is an example of proactive generator consumption:

```python
from prefect import flow


def gen():
    yield from [1, 2, 3]
    print('Generator consumed!')


@flow
def f():
    return gen()


f()  # prints 'Generator consumed!'
```

If you need to return a generator without consuming it, you can `yield` it instead of using `return`. 
Values yielded from generator flows are not considered final results and do not face the same serialization constraints:

```python
from prefect import flow


def gen():
    yield from [1, 2, 3]
    print('Generator consumed!')


@flow
def f():
    yield gen()


generator = next(f())
list(generator) # prints 'Generator consumed!'
```
</Warning>

### Running a flow

A _flow run_ is a single execution of a flow.

Create a flow run by calling a `@flow` decorated function, just as you would a normal Python function.

You can also create a flow run by:

- Using external schedulers such as `cron` to invoke a flow function
- Triggering a [deployment](/v3/how-to-guides/deployments/create-deployments/) of that flow in Prefect Cloud or self-hosted Prefect server
- Starting a flow run for the deployment through a schedule, the Prefect UI, or the Prefect API

However you run your flow, Prefect monitors the flow run, capturing its state for observability.
You can log a [variety of metadata](/v3/how-to-guides/workflows/add-logging) about flow runs for monitoring, troubleshooting, and auditing purposes.

### Specify flow parameters

As with any Python function, you can pass arguments to a flow, including both positional and keyword arguments.
These arguments defined on your flow function are called parameters.
They are stored by the Prefect orchestration engine on the flow run object.

Prefect automatically performs type conversion of inputs using any provided type hints.
Type hints provide a simple way to enforce typing on your flow parameters and can be customized with [Pydantic](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/).
Prefect supports any Pydantic model as a type hint for a flow parameter.

Note that you can provide parameter values to a flow through the API using a [deployment](/v3/how-to-guides/deployments/create-deployments/).
Flow run parameters sent to the API are coerced to the appropriate types when possible.

<Warning>
**Prefect API requires keyword arguments**

When creating flow runs from the Prefect API, you must specify parameter names when overriding defaults.
The values passed cannot be positional.
</Warning>

Parameters are validated before a flow is run.
If a flow run for a deployment receives invalid parameters, it moves from a `Pending` state to a `Failed` state without entering a `Running` state.

<Note>
Flow run parameters cannot exceed `512kb` in size.
</Note>

For a deep dive into flow parameters, see the [form-building tutorial](/v3/how-to-guides/workflows/form-building).

### Organize flows with tasks

Flows can call [tasks](/v3/concepts/tasks), the most granular units of orchestrated work in Prefect workflows.

A single flow function can contain all of your workflow's code.
However, if you put all of your workflow logic in a single flow function and any line of code fails, the entire flow fails and must be retried from the beginning.
The more granular you make your workflows, the better they can recover from failures and the easier you can find and fix issues.

Prefect tasks are well suited for parallel or distributed execution using distributed computation frameworks such as Dask or Ray.

### Nesting flows

In addition to calling tasks from a flow, flows can also call other flows.
A nested flow run is created when a flow function is called by another flow.
When one flow calls another, the calling flow run is the "parent" run, the called flow run is the "child" run.

In the UI, each child flow run is linked to its parent and can be individually observed.

For most purposes, nested flow runs behave just like unnested flow runs.
There is a full representation of the nested flow run in the backend as if it had been called separately.
Nested flow runs differ from normal flow runs in that they resolve any passed task futures into data.
This allows data to be passed from the parent flow run to a nested flow run easily.

When a nested flow run starts, it creates a new [task runner](/v3/concepts/task-runners/) for any tasks it contains.
When the nested flow run completes, the task runner shuts down.
Nested flow runs block execution of the parent flow run until completion.
However, asynchronous nested flows can run concurrently with [AnyIO task groups](https://anyio.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tasks.html) or [asyncio.gather](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html#id6).

The relationship between nested runs is recorded through a special task run in the parent flow run that represents the child flow run.
The `state_details` field of the task run representing the child flow run includes a `child_flow_run_id`.
The `state_details` field of the nested flow run includes a `parent_task_run_id`.

You can define multiple flows within the same file.
Whether running locally or through a [deployment](/v3/how-to-guides/deployments/create-deployments), you must indicate which flow is the entrypoint for a flow run.

<Warning>
**Cancel nested flow runs**

A nested flow run cannot be cancelled without cancelling its parent flow run.
If you need to be able to cancel a nested flow run independent of its parent flow run, we recommend deploying it separately and starting it with
the [run_deployment](https://reference.prefect.io/prefect/deployments/flow_runs/#prefect.deployments.flow_runs.run_deployment) method.
</Warning>

Some scenarios where you might want to define a nested flow rather than call tasks individually include:

- Observability: Nested flows, like any other flow run, have first-class observability within the Prefect UI and Prefect Cloud. You'll
see nested flows' status in the **Runs** dashboard rather than having to dig down into the tasks within a specific flow run.
See [Final state determination](#final-state-determination) for examples of using task state within flows.
- Conditional flows: If you have a group of tasks that run only under certain conditions, you can group them within a nested flow and
conditionally run the nested flow rather than each task individually.
- Parameters: Flows have first-class support for parameterization, making it easy to run the same group of tasks in different use
cases by simply passing different parameters to the nested flow in which they run.
- Task runners: Nested flows enable you to specify the task runner used for tasks within the flow. For example, to optimize
parallel execution of certain tasks with Dask, group them in a nested flow that uses the Dask task runner. You can use a different
task runner for each nested flow.

### Flow runs

A _flow run_ is a single execution of a flow.

You can create a flow run by calling the flow function manually, or even by using an external scheduler such as `cron` to invoke a flow function.
Most users run flows by creating a [deployment](/v3/how-to-guides/deployments/create-deployments/) on Prefect Cloud or Prefect server and then scheduling a flow run for the deployment through a schedule, the Prefect UI, or the Prefect API.

However you run a flow, the Prefect API monitors the flow run and records information for monitoring, troubleshooting, and auditing.

Flows can be configured through optional arguments passed to the `@flow` decorator. For detailed configuration options, see [how to write and run workflows](/v3/how-to-guides/workflows/write-and-run).

### Final state determination

A state is a record of the status of a particular task run or flow run.
See the [states](/v3/concepts/states) page for more information.

import FinalFlowState from '/snippets/final-flow-state.mdx'

<FinalFlowState />

#### Return a future

If a flow returns one or more futures, the final state is determined based on the underlying states.

```python
from prefect import flow, task


@task
def always_fails_task():
    raise ValueError("I fail successfully")


@task
def always_succeeds_task():
    print("I'm fail safe!")
    return "success"


@flow
def always_succeeds_flow():
    x = always_fails_task.submit().result(raise_on_failure=False)
    y = always_succeeds_task.submit(wait_for=[x])
    return y


if __name__ == "__main__":
    always_succeeds_flow()
```

This flow run finishes in a **Completed** final state because the flow returns the future of the task that succeeds.

#### Return multiple states or futures

If a flow returns a mix of futures and states, the final state is determined by resolving all futures to states,
then determining if any of the states are not `COMPLETED`.

```python
from prefect import task, flow


@task
def always_fails_task():
    raise ValueError("I am bad task")


@task
def always_succeeds_task():
    return "foo"


@flow
def always_succeeds_flow():
    return "bar"


@flow
def always_fails_flow():
    x = always_fails_task()
    y = always_succeeds_task()
    z = always_succeeds_flow()
    return x, y, z
```

Running `always_fails_flow` fails because one of the three returned futures fails.

If multiple states are returned, they must be contained in a `set`, `list`, or `tuple`.

#### Return a manual state

If a flow returns a manually created state, the final state is determined based upon the return value.

```python
from prefect import task, flow
from prefect.states import Completed, Failed


@task
def always_fails_task():
    raise ValueError("I fail successfully")


@task
def always_succeeds_task():
    print("I'm fail safe!")
    return "success"


@flow
def always_succeeds_flow():
    x = always_fails_task.submit()
    y = always_succeeds_task.submit()
    if y.result() == "success":
        return Completed(message="I am happy with this result")
    else:
        return Failed(message="How did this happen!?")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    always_succeeds_flow()
```

If a flow run returns any other object, then it is recorded as `COMPLETED`

#### Custom named states

You can also create custom named states to provide more granularity in your flow run states.

For example, we could create a `Skipped` state to indicate that a flow run was skipped.

```python
from prefect import flow
from prefect.states import Completed

@flow
def my_flow(work_to_do: bool):
    if not work_to_do:
        return Completed(message="No work to do 💤", name="Skipped")
    else:
        return Completed(message="Work was done 💪")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    my_flow(work_to_do=False)
```
