title: Variables
description: Variables are dynamically-named, mutable string values than can be used to store and reuse non-sensitive bits of data.
---

Variables enable you to store and reuse non-sensitive bits of data, such as configuration information. 
They are:

- named, mutable values of any JSON type
- scoped to a self-hosted Prefect server instance or a single workspace in a Prefect Cloud account
- meant for values with infrequent writes and frequent reads (but you can create or 
modify variables at any time)
- cacheable for quicker retrieval
- most commonly loaded during flow runtime (but you can load them in other contexts to pass 
configuration information to Prefect configuration files, such as deployment steps)

<Warning>
**Variables are not Encrypted**

We do not recommend using variables to store sensitive information. Instead, use 
[Secret blocks](https://docs.prefect.io/develop/blocks/#prefect-built-in-blocks) to store and access 
sensitive information.
</Warning>

## Manage variables

Create, read, edit, and delete variables through the Prefect UI, API, and CLI. 
Names must adhere to these traditional variable naming conventions:

- Have no more than 255 characters
- Only contain lowercase alphanumeric characters ([a-z], [0-9]) or underscores (_). Spaces are not allowed.
- Be unique

Values must have less than or equal to 5000 characters.

Optionally, you can add tags to a variable.

### Through the Prefect UI

View all the variables in your self-hosted Prefect server instance or Prefect Cloud account workspace 
in the **Variables** page of the Prefect UI. Both the name and value of all variables 
are visible to anyone with access to the server or workspace.

To create a new variable:
1. Select the **+** button next to the header of the **Variables** page. 
1. Enter the name and value of the variable.

### Through the REST API

import { API } from "/snippets/resource-management/api.mdx"
import { variables } from "/snippets/resource-management/vars.mdx"

<API name="variables" href={variables.api} />

### Through the CLI

import { CLI } from "/snippets/resource-management/cli.mdx"

<CLI name="variables" href={variables.cli} />

- `prefect variable set` creates or updates a variable.
- `prefect variable get` retrieves a variable's value.
- `prefect variable unset` deletes a variable.
- `prefect variable ls` lists all variables.
- `prefect variable inspect` shows a variable's details.

### Through Terraform

import { TF } from "/snippets/resource-management/terraform.mdx"

<TF name="variables" href={variables.tf} />
