## API rate limits

<Note>
**Rate limits are subject to change.**

Contact Prefect support at [help@prefect.io](mailto:help@prefect.io) with questions about rate limits.
</Note>

Prefect Cloud applies rate limits to API endpoints to ensure system stability. When limits are exceeded, endpoints return a `429` response with a `Retry-After` header.

### Request limits by plan

The `flow_runs`, `task_runs`, and `flows` endpoints and their subroutes:

- **Hobby**: 250 requests per minute
- **Starter**: 500 requests per minute
- **Team**: 1,000 requests per minute
- **Pro**: 2,000 requests per minute
- **Enterprise**: Custom limits

The `logs` endpoint:

- **Hobby**: 500 logs per minute
- **Starter**: 1,600 logs per minute
- **Team**: 2,000 logs per minute
- **Pro**: 10,000 logs per minute
- **Enterprise**: Custom limits

The Prefect SDK automatically retries rate-limited requests up to 5 times, using the delay specified in the `Retry-After` header. You can customize this behavior through [client settings](/v3/develop/settings-ref#clientsettings).

## Metadata retention

Prefect Cloud retains flow run, task run, and artifact metadata for a limited time based on your plan. This applies to all workspaces in your account.

### Retention periods by plan

- **Hobby and Starter**: 7 days
- **Team**: 14 days  
- **Pro**: 30 days
- **Enterprise**: Custom retention periods

Metadata is retained from creation until the specified period expires. For flow and task runs, retention is calculated from when the run reaches a [terminal state](/v3/develop/manage-states/#state-types). Subflow runs are retained independently from their parent flows.

For custom retention periods, [contact Prefect's sales team](https://www.prefect.io/pricing).
