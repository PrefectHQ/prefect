The Prefect Docs MCP provides AI-powered documentation search without requiring installation or connecting to your Prefect workflows. Prefect hosts an MCP server at `https://docs.prefect.io/mcp` that you can connect to directly.

## Quick start

Configure your AI assistant to connect to the hosted Prefect docs MCP server at:

**Server URL**: `https://docs.prefect.io/mcp`

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Claude Desktop" defaultOpen>

Add to your Claude Desktop configuration (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` on macOS):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "prefect-docs": {
      "url": "https://docs.prefect.io/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

After updating the configuration, restart Claude Desktop.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Cursor">

Add to `.cursor/mcp.json` in your project or home directory:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "prefect-docs": {
      "url": "https://docs.prefect.io/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Cursor after updating the configuration.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="VS Code">

The configuration method depends on your MCP extension. For most MCP extensions, add to your VS Code `settings.json`:

```json
{
  "mcp.servers": {
    "prefect-docs": {
      "url": "https://docs.prefect.io/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

Restart VS Code after updating the configuration.

</Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

## Test your setup

Once configured, try these prompts in your AI assistant to verify the connection:

- "What is a Prefect flow?"
- "How do I create a deployment?"
- "Show me examples of using task caching"
- "What are work pools in Prefect?"

Your AI assistant should be able to search the Prefect documentation and provide answers based on the official docs.

## What you get

With the Prefect Docs MCP server, your AI assistant can:

- **Search documentation**: Find relevant Prefect documentation based on natural language queries
- **Answer questions**: Get contextual answers about Prefect concepts, APIs, and best practices
- **Find examples**: Discover code examples and usage patterns from the docs
- **Stay up-to-date**: Always access the latest version of the Prefect documentation

## Hosted service - no installation needed

The Prefect Docs MCP server is hosted by Prefect at `https://docs.prefect.io/mcp`. You don't need to:
- Install any packages
- Configure credentials
- Run a local server
- Connect to a Prefect instance

It only provides read-only access to public Prefect documentation.

## Need workflow integration too?

If you also want to monitor your Prefect instance, debug flow runs, and query your infrastructure, check out the [Prefect MCP Server](/v3/mcp-servers/prefect-mcp-server). It includes both documentation access and workflow integration capabilities, but requires installation and Prefect credentials.
