The Prefect Docs MCP provides AI-powered documentation search without requiring installation or connecting to your Prefect workflows. Simply configure your AI assistant to use the docs proxy URL.

## Quick start

Add the docs proxy URL to your MCP-compatible AI assistant:

**Docs Proxy URL**: `https://docs.prefect.io/mcp`

## Test your setup

Once configured, try these prompts to verify the connection:

- "What is a Prefect flow?"
- "How do I create a deployment?"
- "Show me examples of using task caching"
- "What are work pools?"

## What you can do

With the Prefect Docs MCP, your AI assistant can:

- **Search documentation**: Find relevant Prefect documentation based on your questions
- **Answer questions**: Get contextual answers about Prefect concepts and APIs
- **Find examples**: Discover code examples and best practices
- **Access current content**: Always get up-to-date information from the official docs

## No installation required

The docs proxy is a hosted service—no credentials, installation, or Prefect instance required. It only accesses public Prefect documentation.

## Want more?

If you also want to monitor your Prefect instance, debug flow runs, and query your infrastructure, check out the [Prefect MCP Server](/v3/mcp-servers/prefect-mcp-server) which includes both documentation access and workflow integration.
