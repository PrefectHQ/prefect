- Prefect Cloud account (SLAs are only available in Prefect Cloud)

## Service Level Agreements

<span class="badge cloud"></span> Service Level Agreements (SLAs) are a way to define the performance expectations for your data stack and to enable automated alerts when those expectations are not met.

SLAs are defined on the Deployment level and can be used to trigger alerts when a flow run fails to adhere to the SLA. For example, you can define an SLA that triggers an alert if a flow run takes longer than 10 minutes to complete. When the SLA is triggered, an event is emitted and can be used to trigger an [automation](/v3/automate/events/automations-triggers/) to notify a team or to take other actions.

## Defining SLAs

To define an SLA you can add them to the Deployment either through the `prefect.yaml` file, through using a `.deploy` method, or the CLI:
<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="Defining SLAs in your prefect.yaml file">
```yaml prefect.yaml SLA
deployments:
  my-deployment:
    sla:
        - name: "my-sla"
          duration: 10
          severity: "high"
```
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Defining SLAs using a .deploy method">
```python .deploy SLA
    flow.from_source(
        source=source,
        entrypoint="my_file.py:my_flow",
    ).deploy(
        name="private-bitbucket-deploy",
        work_pool_name="my_pool",
        sla=[
            {
                "name": "my-sla",
                "duration": 10,
                "severity": "high"
            }
        ]
    )
```
</Accordion>    

<Accordion title="Defining SLAs with the Prefect CLI">
```bash CLI SLA
prefect deploy --sla '{"name": "my-sla", "duration": 10, "severity": "high"}'
```
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
## Monitoring SLAs

You can monitor SLAs in the Prefect Cloud UI. On the runs page you can see the SLA status in the top level metrics:

## Setting up an automation

To set up an automation to notify a team or to take other actions when an SLA is triggered, you can use the [automations](/v3/automate/events/automations-triggers/) feature. To create the automation first you'll need to create a trigger.

1. Choose trigger type 'Custom'.
2. Choose any event matching: `prefect.sla.sla-violation`
3. For "From the Following Resources" choose: `prefect.flow-run.*`

After creating the trigger, you can create an automation to notify a team or to take other actions when an SLA is triggered using the [automations](/v3/automate/events/automations-triggers/) feature.
