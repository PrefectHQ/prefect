## Overview

When a flow run fails due to a bug in your code, you typically need to:
1. Fix the bug in a pull request
2. Merge the PR
3. Manually retry the failed flow run

This guide shows how to automate step 3 by creating a webhook and automation that automatically resumes a failed flow run when a PR containing the flow run URL is merged.

## Prerequisites

- A Prefect Cloud workspace
- A GitHub repository with webhook access
- A failed flow run you want to resume

## Step 1: Create a webhook

Create a webhook in Prefect Cloud that transforms GitHub PR events into Prefect events. The webhook template extracts the flow run ID from the PR body when present.

Navigate to your workspace's **Webhooks** page and create a new webhook with this template:

```jinja
{
  "event": "github.{{ headers.get('x-github-event', 'unknown') }}.{{ body.action|default('no-action') }}",
  "resource": {
    "prefect.resource.id": "{% set pr_body = body.pull_request.body|default('') %}{% if '/flow-run/' in pr_body %}prefect.flow-run.{{ pr_body.split('/flow-run/')[1].split('/')[0].split('?')[0].split('#')[0].split('\n')[0] }}{% else %}github.pr.{{ body.pull_request.number|default(0) }}{% endif %}",
    "pr.number": "{{ body.pull_request.number|default(0) }}",
    "pr.merged": "{{ body.pull_request.merged|default(false) }}",
    "pr.title": "{{ body.pull_request.title|default('')|truncate(100) }}"
  }
}
```

This template:
- Sets the event type to `github.pull_request.<action>` (e.g., `github.pull_request.closed`)
- Extracts the flow run ID from any Prefect Cloud URL in the PR body
- Falls back to `github.pr.<number>` if no flow run URL is found
- Includes `pr.merged` as a resource label for filtering

Copy the webhook URL for the next step.

## Step 2: Configure GitHub webhook

In your GitHub repository:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Webhooks** → **Add webhook**
2. Set the **Payload URL** to your Prefect webhook URL
3. Set **Content type** to `application/json`
4. Under **Which events would you like to trigger this webhook?**, select **Let me select individual events** and check **Pull requests**
5. Click **Add webhook**

## Step 3: Create an automation

Create an automation that triggers when a PR is merged and the event contains a flow run ID.

Navigate to your workspace's **Automations** page and create a new automation:

**Trigger configuration:**
- **Trigger type**: Event
- **Event name**: `github.pull_request.closed`
- **Resource**: Match `prefect.resource.id` starting with `prefect.flow-run.`
- **Resource labels**: Match `pr.merged` equals `True`

**Action configuration:**
- **Action type**: Change flow run state
- **New state**: Scheduled
- **Force**: Yes (required to transition from Failed state)

The automation extracts the flow run ID from the event's `prefect.resource.id` and changes its state to resume execution.

## Step 4: Use the workflow

When a flow run fails:

1. Create a PR to fix the issue
2. Include the flow run URL in the PR body:
   ```
   This PR fixes the data validation issue.

   Fixes: https://app.prefect.cloud/account/.../workspace/.../runs/flow-run/abc123-...
   ```
3. Merge the PR
4. The automation triggers and resumes the flow run

## Example flow

Here's a simple flow that reads configuration and can fail based on its contents:

```python example_flow.py
import json
from pathlib import Path
from prefect import flow


@flow(log_prints=True)
def my_flow():
    config = json.loads(Path("config.json").read_text())

    if error := config.get("error"):
        raise ValueError(f"Flow failed: {error}")

    print("Flow completed successfully!")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    my_flow()
```

If this flow fails due to a bad config, you can:
1. Fix `config.json` in a PR
2. Include the failed flow run URL in the PR body
3. Merge to automatically resume the flow run

## How it works

1. **GitHub sends webhook**: When a PR is closed, GitHub sends a POST request to your Prefect webhook
2. **Webhook transforms event**: The Jinja template extracts the flow run ID from the PR body and creates a Prefect event with `prefect.resource.id` set to `prefect.flow-run.<uuid>`
3. **Automation matches**: The automation triggers on `github.pull_request.closed` events where `pr.merged` is `True` and the resource ID matches a flow run
4. **State change**: The automation changes the flow run state to `Scheduled`, which resumes execution
