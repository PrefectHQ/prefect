Prefect provides a number of [settings](/v3/concepts/settings-and-profiles) that help secure a self-hosted Prefect server.

## Basic Authentication

Self-hosted Prefect servers can be equipped with Basic Authentication through two settings:

- **`server.api.auth_string="admin:pass"`**: this setting should be set with an administrator / password combination, separated by a colon, on any process that hosts the Prefect webserver (for example `prefect server start`).
- **`api.auth_string="admin:pass"`**: this setting should be set with the same administrator / password combination as the server on any client process that needs to communicate with the Prefect API (for example, any process that runs a workflow).

With these settings, the UI will prompt for the full authentication string `"admin:pass"` (no quotes) upon first load. It is recommended to store this information in a secure way, such as a Kubernetes Secret or in a private `.env` file.

<Warning>
**Note on API keys**

API keys are only used for [authenticating with Prefect Cloud](/v3/how-to-guides/cloud/manage-users/api-keys).

If both `PREFECT_API_KEY` and `PREFECT_API_AUTH_STRING` are set on the client, `PREFECT_API_KEY` will take precedence. If you plan to use a
self-hosted Prefect server, make sure `PREFECT_API_KEY` is not set in your active profile or as
an environment variable, otherwise authentication will fail (`HTTP 401 Unauthorized`). 
</Warning>

Example `.env` file:

```bash .env
PREFECT_SERVER_API_AUTH_STRING="admin:pass"
PREFECT_API_AUTH_STRING="admin:pass"
```

## Host the UI behind a reverse proxy

When using a reverse proxy (such as [Nginx](https://nginx.org) or [Traefik](https://traefik.io)) to proxy traffic to a 
 hosted Prefect UI instance, you must also configure the self-hosted Prefect server instance to connect to the API. 
The [`ui.api_url`](/v3/develop/settings-ref/#api_url) setting should be set to the external proxy URL.

For example, if your external URL is `https://prefect-server.example.com` then you can configure a `prefect.toml` file for your server like this:

```toml prefect.toml
[ui]
api_url = "https://prefect-server.example.com/api"
```

If you do not set `ui.api_url`, then `api.url` will be used as a fallback.

## CSRF protection settings

If using self-hosted Prefect server, you can configure CSRF protection settings.

- [`server.api.csrf_protection_enabled`](/v3/develop/settings-ref/#csrf-protection-enabled): activates CSRF protection on the server, 
requiring valid CSRF tokens for applicable requests. Recommended for production to prevent CSRF attacks. 
Defaults to `False`.
- [`server.api.csrf_token_expiration`](/v3/develop/settings-ref/#csrf-token-expiration): sets the expiration duration for server-issued CSRF tokens, 
influencing how often tokens need to be refreshed. The default is 1 hour.
- [`client.csrf_support_enabled`](/v3/develop/settings-ref/#csrf-support-enabled): enables or disables CSRF token handling in the Prefect client. 
When enabled, the client manages CSRF tokens for state-changing API requests. Defaults to `True`.

By default clients expect that CSRF protection is enabled on the server. If you are running a server without CSRF protection, 
you can disable CSRF support in the client.

## CORS settings

If using self-hosted Prefect server, you can configure CORS settings to control which origins are allowed to make cross-origin requests to your server.

- [`server.api.cors_allowed_origins`](/v3/develop/settings-ref/#cors-allowed-origins): a list of origins that are allowed to make cross-origin requests.
- [`server.api.cors_allowed_methods`](/v3/develop/settings-ref/#cors-allowed-methods): a list of HTTP methods that are allowed to be used during cross-origin requests.
- [`server.api.cors_allowed_headers`](/v3/develop/settings-ref/#cors-allowed-headers): a list of headers that are allowed to be used during cross-origin requests.
