The `prefect transfer` command enables you to migrate resources between different Prefect environments, whether moving from development to production, from self-hosted to cloud, or between cloud workspaces.

<Info>
The transfer command is available in Prefect [3.4.14](/v3/release-notes/oss/version-3-4) and later.
</Info>

## Quick start

Transfer all resources from a development environment to production:

```bash
prefect transfer --from local --to cloud
```

The command will:
1. Discover all resources in the source profile
2. Analyze dependencies between resources
3. Transfer resources in the correct order
4. Report success, failures, and skipped resources

## Understanding resource dependencies

Prefect resources have complex dependencies that the transfer command automatically handles:

- **Deployments** depend on flows, work pools, and storage blocks
- **Work queues** depend on work pools
- **Block documents** depend on block types and schemas
- **Automations** depend on deployments, work pools, and blocks

The transfer command builds a dependency graph and transfers resources in the correct order, ensuring that dependencies are satisfied.

## Common transfer scenarios

### Development to production

Transfer resources between different environments:

```bash
prefect transfer --from dev-profile --to prod-profile
```

### Self-hosted to cloud migration

Move from a self-hosted Prefect server to Prefect Cloud:

```bash
prefect transfer --from self-hosted-profile --to cloud-profile
```

<Warning>
When transferring to Prefect Cloud Hobby tier workspaces, certain resource types may be skipped due to tier limitations.
</Warning>

### Workspace consolidation

Resources can be transferred between multiple workspaces. Resources that already exist in the destination will be skipped.

## Resource handling

### Work pools

The transfer command handles different work pool types according to the destination:

- **Hybrid pools** (process, docker, kubernetes): Transfer to any destination (except Prefect Cloud Hobby tier workspaces)
- **Push pools**: Transfer only to Prefect Cloud destinations (except Prefect Cloud Hobby tier workspaces)
- **Managed pools**: Never transferred

### Existing resources

Resources that already exist in the destination are skipped you can run it multiple times safely.

```bash
# First run
prefect transfer --from dev --to prod
# Output: 25 succeeded, 0 skipped

# Second run (idempotent)
prefect transfer --from dev --to prod
# Output: 0 succeeded, 25 skipped
```

### Resource limits

When transferring to Prefect Cloud workspaces, certain resources may be skipped based on tier limitations. The transfer command will provide clear messages explaining why resources were skipped.

## Understanding the output

The transfer command provides detailed status for each resource:

```bash
Transfer Results
┏━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━━┳━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┓
┃ Resource               ┃ Status    ┃ Details                    ┃
┡━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━━━╇━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━┩
│ flow/my-flow           │ ✓ Success │                            │
│ work-pool/k8s-pool     │ ✓ Success │                            │
│ deployment/my-deploy   │ ✓ Success │                            │
│ variable/api-key       │ ✓ Success │                            │
│ work-pool/managed      │ ⊘ Skipped │ Skipped managed pool       │
│ work-pool/push-pool    │ ⊘ Skipped │ Skipped - requires Cloud   │
└────────────────────────┴───────────┴────────────────────────────┘

Transfer completed: 4 succeeded, 2 skipped
```

Status indicators:
- **✓ Success**: Resource transferred successfully
- **⊘ Skipped**: Resource skipped (with reason)
- **✗ Failed**: Transfer failed (with error details)

## Limitations

### Resources not transferred

Certain resources cannot be transferred between environments:
- Flow run history and logs
- Result artifacts and cached data  
- Cloud-specific infrastructure resources
- Credentials and secrets (must be recreated in the destination)

### Environment-specific configuration

Some resources may require manual configuration after transfer to work correctly in the new environment, particularly those that reference external systems or credentials.

## Best practices

### Pre-transfer checklist

1. **Verify profiles**: Ensure both source and destination profiles are correctly configured
   ```bash
   prefect profile inspect source-profile
   prefect profile inspect dest-profile
   ```

2. **Test connectivity**: Confirm you can connect to both environments
   ```bash
   prefect --profile source-profile config view
   prefect --profile dest-profile config view
   ```

3. **Check tier limitations**: Understand destination workspace capabilities
   - Hobby tier: Managed pools only, 5 deployment limit
   - Standard/Pro tier: Full resource support

### Post-transfer validation

After transferring resources:

1. **Verify critical resources**:
   ```bash
   prefect --profile dest-profile work-pool ls
   prefect --profile dest-profile deployment ls
   ```

2. **Test a deployment**:
   ```bash
   prefect --profile dest-profile deployment run my-deployment/my-flow
   ```

3. **Check automation status**:
   ```bash
   prefect --profile dest-profile automation ls
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### Common issues

**Resources skipped as "already exists"**
- This is expected when resources already exist in the destination
- The transfer can be run multiple times safely

**Resources skipped due to tier limitations**
- Some resource types require specific Prefect Cloud tiers
- Check your workspace tier and capabilities

**Connection errors**
- Verify both profiles are correctly configured
- Check network connectivity and authentication

### Debug mode

For detailed transfer information, enable debug logging:

```bash
PREFECT_LOGGING_LEVEL=DEBUG prefect transfer --from source --to dest
```
