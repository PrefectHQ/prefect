description: Declaratively manage Prefect resources with additional tools
---

You can manage many Prefect resources with tools like
[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) and [Helm](https://helm.sh/).  These
options are a viable alternative to Prefect's CLI and UI.

## Terraform

import { TF } from "/snippets/resource-management/terraform.mdx"
import { home } from "/snippets/resource-management/vars.mdx"

<TF name="resources" href={home.tf} />

This documentation represents all Prefect resources that are supported by Terraform.
This Terraform provider is maintained by the Prefect team, and is undergoing active development
to reach [parity with the Prefect API](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/terraform-provider-prefect/milestone/1).

The Prefect team welcomes contributions, feature requests, and bug reports
via our [issue tracker](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/terraform-provider-prefect/issues).

### Terraform Modules

Prefect maintains several Terraform modules to help you get started with common infrastructure patterns:

* [Bucket Sensors for AWS, Azure, and GCP](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/terraform-prefect-bucket-sensor)
* [ECS Worker on AWS Fargate](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/terraform-prefect-ecs-worker)
* [ACI Worker on Azure Container Instances](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/terraform-prefect-aci-worker)

## Helm

import { HELM } from "/snippets/resource-management/helm.mdx"

<HELM name="resources" href={home.helm} />

Each Helm chart subdirectory contains usage documentation. There are two main charts:

- The `prefect-server` chart is used to a deploy a Prefect server. This is an alternative to using
  [Prefect Cloud](https://app.prefect.cloud/).
- The `prefect-worker` chart is used to deploy a [Prefect worker](/v3/deploy/infrastructure-concepts/workers).

Finally, there is a `prefect-prometheus-exporter` chart that is used to deploy a Prometheus exporter,
exposing Prefect metrics for monitoring and alerting.
