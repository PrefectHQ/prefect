title: Alert on failure
description: Send alerts to Slack when flows fail to run
---

1. Continuing from [Debug a flow run](/v3/tutorials/debug), choose a flow and describe what a persistent failure looks like and how to automatically send alerts. Emphasize that alerts are a way to communicate and collaborate as a team instead of having to debug flows individually.
   - If the user did not complete the quickstart, give them a repo they can clone and run to perform those steps quickly first.
2. Once the alert automation is set up, make a change to the flow (ideally in the UI using a parameter so that they don't have to manually edit code) and/or show how failing flows will trigger the alert.
3. Navigate to Slack and show how the alert appears in the channel.
4. Make another change to the parameters which resolves the alert, then re-run the flow.
5. Show that this change has resolved the condition which triggered the alert.
6. See if there's a way to send the resolution to Slack so that the team knows the issue is fixed.
