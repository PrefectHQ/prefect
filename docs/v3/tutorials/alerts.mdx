title: Send alerts to Slack on failure
description: Learn how to use automations to notify your team when a flow fails.
---

In the [Debug a data pipeline](/v3/tutorials/debug) tutorial, you learned how to troubleshoot flow runs that fail.
In this tutorial, you'll learn how to set up a Slack alert which proactively notifies your team about failures.
Alerts let people who don't typically log into Prefect Cloud engage with the troubleshooting process.

<Info>
This tutorial starts where the [Set up a platform for data pipelines](/v3/tutorials/platform) tutorial leaves off, so complete that one first.
You will need a paid Prefect Cloud account.

## Set up an automation

Automations are used to set up alerts in Prefect.
First, you need to create a new automation.

1. Sign in to Prefect Cloud, and use the workspace switcher to open the `staging` workspace.
1. Go to **Automations**, and then click **Add Automation**.

### Specify the trigger

An automation triggers whenever a specified condition is met.

1. Select the **Flow run state** trigger type.
1. Trigger whenever the `data-pipeline` flow has flow runs that enter the **Failed** state.
1. Click **Next** to go to the next step.

### Specify the action

Once an automation triggers, it can perform one or more actions.

1. Choose the **Send a notification** action type
1. In order to send a notification to Slack, you need to create a block.
Blocks store configuration and provide an interface for external systems like Slack.
    1. Under **Block**, click **Add**.
    1. Find the **Slack Webhook** block, and then click **Create**.
    1. Specify `slack-alerts` as the block name, and provide the [Slack webhook URL](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks)
  1. Choose the **failure** notify type, and then click **Create**.
1. Click **Next** to go to the next step.

### Save the automation

Give the automation a name and description so that you can identify its purpose later.

1. Name: `slack-alert`
2. Description: `Send a Slack message when the 'data-pipeline' flow fails`
3. Click **Save**.

You've now created an automation that sends a Slack message whenever the `data-pipeline` flow in the `staging` workspace has a failed run.

## Test the alert

To test the alert, you need to trigger a flow run failure in the `staging` workspace.

```bash
prefect cloud workspace set --workspace "<account handle>/staging"
python simulate_failures.py --fail-at-run 1
```

After the script finishes, you should see ten Slack messages, one for each flow run failure.
Each message should look similar to the following:

> Prefect flow run notification<br/>
> Flow run data-pipeline/courageous-buffalo observed in state Failed at 2024-12-11 18:59:17.212585+00:00.<br/>
> Flow ID: 89053371-0d7e-4ef6-9a5f-63ea69689f66<br/>
> Flow run ID: 33c2dac9-7d2a-48dd-a8cf-3894c6cd6063<br/>
> Flow run URL: https:&#8203;//app.prefect.cloud/account/9b649228-0419-40e1-9e0d-44954b5c0ab6/workspace/a2127afa-ad10-4862-bdb0-5d065df64c8a/flow-runs/flow-run/33c2dac9-7d2a-48dd-a8cf-3894c6cd6063<br/>
> State message: Flow run encountered an exception: Exception: Run failed

You can open the URL to view the flow run in Prefect Cloud.

## Next steps

In this tutorial, you successfully used Prefect Cloud to set up a Slack alert.
