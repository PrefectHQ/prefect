title: Automate deployments with CI/CD
description: Deploy workflows automatically when your teams push commits to GitHub
---

In the [Set up a platform for data pipelines](/v3/tutorials/platform) tutorial, you learned how to deploy flows to multiple workspaces, mirroring your development lifecycle.
However, in the real world, you don't want to run workers and deployments manually from your laptop.

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to automate deployments with CI/CD.
We'll use Docker Hub and GitHub Actions to automatically deploy flows whenever your teams commit code to GitHub.

## Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial, you'll need:

- To complete the [Set up a platform for data pipelines](/v3/tutorials/platform) tutorial, as you'll continue building off of that environment
- A [GitHub](https://github.com) account
- A [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com) account

## Get third-party credentials

TBD

## Create a service account in Prefect Cloud

TBD

## Set up a GitHub workflow

TBD

## Next steps

In this tutorial, you successfully automated the process of deploying data pipelines to Prefect Cloud.
With this setup, your teams can get the compute they need without having to learn yet another tool.
