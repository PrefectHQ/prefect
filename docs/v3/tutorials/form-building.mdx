Parameterizing workflows is a critical part of orchestration. It allows you to create contracts between modular workflows in your organization and empower less-technical users to interact with your workflows intuitively.

[Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/) is a powerful library for data validation using Python type annotations, which is used by Prefect to build a parameter schema for your workflow.

This allows you to:
- check runtime parameter values against the schema (from the UI or the SDK)
- build a user-friendly form in the Prefect UI
- easily reuse parameter types in similar workflows

In this tutorial, we'll craft a workflow signature that the Prefect UI will render as a self-documenting form.


## Motivation

Let's say you have a workflow that triggers a marketing email blast which looks like:

{/* pmd-metadata: notest */}
```python
@flow
def send_marketing_email(
    mailing_lists: list[str],
    subject: str,
    body: str,
    test_mode: bool = False,
    attachments: list[str] | None = None
):
    """
    Send a marketing email blast to the given lists.

    Args:
        mailing_lists: A list of lists to email.
        subject: The subject of the email.
        body: The body of the email.
        test_mode: Whether to send a test email.
        attachments: A list of attachments to include in the email.
    """
    ...
```

When you deploy this flow, Prefect will automatically inspect your function signature and generate a form for you:

![initial form](/v3/img/tutorials/parameters/0.png)

This is good enough for many cases, but consider these additional constraints that could arise from business needs or tech stack restrictions:


- there are only a few valid values for `mailing_lists`
- the `subject` must not exceed 30 characters
- no more than 5 `attachments` are allowed

You _can_ simply check these constraints in the body of your flow function:

{/* pmd-metadata: notest */}
```python
@flow
def send_marketing_email(...):
    if len(subject) > 30:
        raise ValueError("Subject must be less than 30 characters")
    if mailing_lists not in ["newsletter", "customers", "beta-testers"]:
        raise ValueError("Invalid list to email")
    if len(attachments) > 5:
        raise ValueError("Too many attachments")
    
    # etc...
```

but there are several downsides to this:
- you have to spin up the infrastructure associated with your flow in order to check the constraints, which is wasteful if it turns out that bad parameters were provided
- this might get duplicative, especially if you have similarly constrained parameters for different workflows

To improve on this, we will use `pydantic` to build a convenient, self-documenting, and reusable flow signature that the Prefect UI can build a better form from.

## Building a convenient flow signature

Let's address the constraints on `mailing_lists`, `subject`, and `attachments`.


### Using `Literal` to restrict valid values
> there are only a few valid values for `mailing_lists`

Say our valid mailing lists are: `["newsletter", "customers", "beta-testers"]`

We can define a `Literal` to specify the valid values for the `mailing_lists` parameter.

```python
from typing import Literal

MailingList = Literal["newsletter", "customers", "beta-testers"]
```

<Tip>
You can use an `Enum` to achieve the same effect.

```python
from enum import Enum

class MailingList(Enum):
    NEWSLETTER = "newsletter"
    CUSTOMERS = "customers"
    BETA_TESTERS = "beta-testers"
```

</Tip>



### Using a `BaseModel` subclass to group and constrain parameters
Both the `subject` and `attachments` parameters have constraints that we want to enforce.

> the `subject` must not exceed 30 characters

> the `attachments` must not exceed 5 items

Additionally, the `subject`, `body`, and `attachments` parameters are all related to the same thing: the content of the email.

We can define a `BaseModel` subclass to group these parameters together and apply these constraints.

{/* pmd-metadata: notest */}
```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

class EmailContent(BaseModel):
    subject: str = Field(max_length=30)
    body: str = Field(default=...)
    attachments: list[str] = Field(default_factory=list, max_length=5)
```

<Tip>
`pydantic.Field` accepts a `description` kwarg that is displayed in the form above the field input.

{/* pmd-metadata: notest */}
```python
subject: str = Field(description="The subject of the email", max_length=30)
```

![field description](/v3/img/tutorials/parameters/4.png)

Similarly, you can:
- pass `title` to `Field` to override the field name in the form
- define a docstring for `EmailContent` to add a description to this group of parameters in the form

</Tip>

### Rewriting the flow signature

Now that we have defined the `MailingList` and `EmailContent` types, we can use them in our flow signature:

{/* pmd-metadata: notest */}
```python
@flow
def send_marketing_email(
    mailing_lists: list[MailingList],
    content: EmailContent,
    test_mode: bool = False,
):
    ...
```

The resulting form looks like this:

![improved form](/v3/img/tutorials/parameters/1.png)


where the `mailing_lists` parameter renders as a multi-select dropdown that only allows the `Literal` values from our `MailingList` type.

![multi-select](/v3/img/tutorials/parameters/2.png)


and any constraints you've defined on the `EmailContent` fields will be enforced before the run is submitted.

<Accordion title="Full example code so far">

{/* pmd-metadata: notest */}
```python
from typing import Literal

from prefect import flow
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

MailingList = Literal["newsletter", "customers", "beta-testers"]


class EmailContent(BaseModel):
    subject: str = Field(max_length=30)
    body: str = Field(default=...)
    attachments: list[str] = Field(default_factory=list, max_length=5)


@flow
def send_marketing_email(
    mailing_list: list[MailingList],
    content: EmailContent,
    test_mode: bool = False,
):
    pass


if __name__ == "__main__":
    send_marketing_email.serve()
```


</Accordion>

### Using `json_schema_extra` to order fields in the form

By default, your flow parameters are rendered in the order defined by your `@flow` function signature.

Within a given `BaseModel` subclass, parameters are rendered in the following order:
- parameters with a `default` value are rendered first, alphabetically
- parameters without a `default` value are rendered next, alphabetically

You can control the order of the parameters within a `BaseModel` subclass by passing `json_schema_extra` to the `Field` constructor with a `position` key.

Taking our `EmailContent` model from the previous example, let's enforce that `subject` should be displayed first, then `body`, then `attachments`.

{/* pmd-metadata: notest */}
```python
class EmailContent(BaseModel):
    subject: str = Field(
        max_length=30,
        description="The subject of the email",
        json_schema_extra=dict(position=0),
    )
    body: str = Field(default=..., json_schema_extra=dict(position=1))
    attachments: list[str] = Field(
        default_factory=list,
        max_length=5,
        json_schema_extra=dict(position=2),
    )
```

The resulting form looks like this:

## Recap

We have now embedded the constraints on our parameters in the types that describe our flow signature, which means:
- the UI can enforce these constraints before the run is submitted - **less wasted infra cycles**
- workflow inputs are **self-documenting**, both in the UI and in the code defining your workflow
- the types used in this signature can be **easily reused** for other similar workflows


## Debugging and related resources

As you craft a schema for your flow signature, you may want to inspect the raw OpenAPI schema that `pydantic` generates, as it is what the Prefect UI uses to build the form.

Call `model_json_schema()` on your `BaseModel` subclass to inspect the raw schema.

{/* pmd-metadata: notest */}
```python
from rich import print as pprint
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

class EmailContent(BaseModel):
    subject: str = Field(max_length=30)
    body: str = Field(default=...)
    attachments: list[str] = Field(default_factory=list, max_length=5)

pprint(EmailContent.model_json_schema())
```
```
{
    'properties': {
        'subject': {'maxLength': 30, 'title': 'Subject', 'type': 'string'},
        'body': {'title': 'Body', 'type': 'string'},
        'attachments': {'items': {'type': 'string'}, 'maxItems': 5, 'title': 'Attachments', 'type': 'array'}
    },
    'required': ['subject', 'body'],
    'title': 'EmailContent',
    'type': 'object'
}
```
