title: Manage an incident
description: Communicate with your team about incidents and collaborate to resolve them.
---

1. Continuing from [Debug a flow run](/v3/tutorials/debug), choose a flow and describe what an incident would look like and how to automatically trigger one. Emphasize that incidents are a way to collaborate as a team on problems instead of having to debug flows manually.
   - If the user did not complete the quickstart, give them a repo they can clone and run to perform those steps quickly first.
2. Once the incident automation is set up, make a change to the flow (ideally in the UI using a parameter so that they don't have to manually edit code) and/or show how failing flows will trigger the incident.
3. Navigate to the incidents UI and show how to collaborate with comments and status/severity updates.
   - For example, leave a comment which says "this incident is because of change X to the flow parameters".
4. Make another change to the parameters which resolves the incident, then re-run the flow.
5. Show that this change has resolved the condition which triggered the incident.
6. Once the incident is resolved, leave a resolution comment ("amended the flow parameters to Y to resolve the incident").
