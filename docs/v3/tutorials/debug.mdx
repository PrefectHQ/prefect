title: Debug a flow run
description: Find out when flow runs go wrong and how to troubleshoot them.

In the [previous tutorial](/v3/tutorials/platform), you used Prefect Cloud to set up a platform for data pipelines.
In this tutorial, you'll learn what to do when those data pipelines fail.

## Prerequisites

If you haven't completed the [previous tutorial](/v3/tutorials/platform), do that first.

## Find failures

TBD: Show them how to use the workspace switcher and the dashboard to find failures.

## Debug failures

TBD: Show them how to use the run detail page to find the line of code that is failing, and then fix the code.

## Verify fix

TBD: Show how to deploy their fixed code, run it, and verify that everything is working successfully.

## Next steps

In this tutorial, you successfully used Prefect Cloud to fix a failing data pipeline.

To take this to the next level, learn how to [set up an alert](/v3/automate/events/automations-triggers) so that you get notified about failures automatically.
