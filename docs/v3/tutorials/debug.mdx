title: Debug a data pipeline
description: Learn how to troubleshoot flow runs that fail.
---

In the [Set up a platform for data pipelines](/v3/tutorials/platform) tutorial, you used Prefect Cloud to set up a platform for data pipelines.
In this tutorial, you'll learn what to do when those data pipelines fail.

<Info>
This tutorial starts where the [previous tutorial](/v3/tutorials/platform) leaves off, so complete that one first.
You will need a paid Prefect Cloud account.
</Info>

## Find failures

You can use the Prefect Cloud dashboard to find failures.

1. Sign in to Prefect Cloud
1. Use the workspace switcher to open the `staging` workspace that you created in the last tutorial.
1. Go to **Home**, and look for red bars in the **Flow Runs** section, these indicate failed flow runs.
1. Hover over a red bar to see more details about the flow run: name, deployment, duration, timestamp, and tags.

<Note>
You can filter by a specific tag (e.g. `team-a`) if you're only interested in a specific set of flows.
</Note>

## Debug a failure

A single flow might experience failures on several runs.
When this happens, it can be helpful to inspect the first failure in the series.

1. In the **Flow Runs** section on the **Home** page, expand the `data-pipeline` flow.
1. You will see a list of failing `data-pipeline` flow runs, in reverse chronological order.
1. Use the pagination controls to navigate to the last failure in the list, this is the first failure that occurred.
1. Click the name of the flow run to go to its detail page.
1. From the flow run detail page, scroll down to the **Logs** section in the right panel.
1. Look for an error message similar to the following:
+
```
File "/opt/prefect/demos/simulate_failures.py", line 12, in process_data
    raise Exception(f"Run failed")
```

It looks like there's an error in the `simulate_failures.py` file.
Now that you've found the failure, the next step is to fix the underlying code.

## Update the code

Open the `simulate_failures.py` file and look at line 12.

```python simulate_failures.py {12}
import argparse
import asyncio
from typing import Optional

from prefect import flow, task
from prefect.client.orchestration import get_client


@task
def process_data(run: int, fail_at_run: Optional[int] = None) -> bool:
    """Simulate data processing with failures"""
    
    # Simulate persistent failures
    if fail_at_run and run > fail_at_run:
        raise Exception(f"Run failed")
    
    return True

# ...
```

The `if` statement is the problem.
If you specify the `--fail_at_run` flag, once the flow runs more than `fail_at_run` times, the flow fails with an exception.
Remove the `if` statement to fix this failure.
We added this statement to give you something to fix. :) 

```python simulate_failures.py
import argparse
import asyncio
from typing import Optional
from prefect import flow, task
from prefect.client.orchestration import get_client

@task
def process_data(run: int, fail_at_run: Optional[int] = None) -> bool:
    """Simulate data processing with failures"""
    
    return True

# ...
```

Now, all flow runs succeed in spite of the `--fail-at-run` flag.
Deploy the fix to the staging workspace to confirm this new behavior.

```bash
prefect cloud workspace set --workspace "<account handle>/staging"
python simulate_failures.py --fail-at-run 3
```

After the script finishes, open the **Home** page in Prefect Cloud to verify that the flow run is no longer failing.

You can now switch workspaces to update the code used in the production workspace as well.

```bash
prefect cloud workspace set --workspace "<account handle>/production"
python simulate_failures.py
```


## Next steps

In this tutorial, you successfully used Prefect Cloud to fix a failing data pipeline.
To learn more about the different states that can occur during the flow run lifecycle, see [Manage states](/v3/develop/manage-states).

Next, learn how to [alert your team](/v3/tutorials/alerts) when failures occur.
