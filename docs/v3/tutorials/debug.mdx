title: Debug a flow run
description: Find out when flow runs go wrong and how to troubleshoot them.
---

1. Continuing from [Set up a data platform](/v3/tutorials/platform), show how to view failing runs in the UI
   - If the reader hasn't completed the quickstart, give them links to:
      1. a Terraform repo they can clone and run to provision Prefect Cloud
      2. a Prefect repo they can clone and run to populate their workspace with the flows needed demonstrate debugging (this can be the same as the one used in the operator quickstart).
2. Show them how to verify which flows failed, and how to go about debugging them.
   - This will involve navigating to the run detail page.
3. Once they've fixed the issues, show them how to run the failed flows again manually and then verify that they ran successfully.
