title: Set up a data platform
description: Give your data team the ability to deploy and run workflows.
---

1. Install the Prefect Server or create a Prefect Cloud account
2. Set up work pool(s)
3. Set up user account(s)
   - Pretend these are for team members who need access to the data platform
4. Set up access permissions so that users can deploy to the work pools
5. Simulate users deploying to the work pool
   - We'll provide a Prefect repo they can just clone and run. This repo should contain a more complex set of flows and tasks than the author quickstart, since operators are primarily interested in managing data platforms and the associated level of complexity. Assign fake team labels so that we can demonstrate filtering.
6. View the run details in the UI (Dashboard), filter by team label.
