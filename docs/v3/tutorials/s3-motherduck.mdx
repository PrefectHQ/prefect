description: Build an ETL pipeline that stores data in S3 and MotherDuck. 
---
import { Arcade } from '/snippets/arcade.mdx'

In this tutorial, you'll create an ETL pipeline which processes and stores Major League Baseball (MLB) game data in S3 and MotherDuck.

## Prerequisites

* A free [Prefect Cloud account](https://app.prefect.cloud/)
* A free [MotherDuck account](https://motherduck.com/)
* An [AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/free/)

### Setup the environment

The code example for the tutorial can be found in the [dev-day-zoom-out repository](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/dev-day-zoom-out).

To kick things off, clone the `dev-day-zoom-out` repository by running the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PrefectHQ/dev-day-zoom-out.git
```
Follow along with the `README.md` file at the root of the repository to set up your environment.
After setting up your environment, navigate to the directory where all the code for this tutorial is located.

```bash
cd dev-day-zoom-out/track_1_build_workflows/session_2_resilent_workflows/1_starting_flow
```

You're more than welcome to work off the existing example, but if you'd like to start fresh, follow the tutorial end-to-end to build your very own pipeline!

## Set up S3 and MotherDuck resources
Before building your pipeline, you'll need to set up the necessary resources in AWS, MotherDuck, and Prefect Cloud.
If you're a seasoned AWS user and already have an IAM User and S3 bucket ready to go, you can skip to the [Create a Prefect AWS Credentials block](#create-a-prefect-aws-credentials-block) section.

### Create AWS resources and Prefect blocks
The following steps will help you set up the AWS resources and Prefect blocks for your workflow.
Sign in to the [AWS Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/) to create an AWS IAM User and an AWS S3 bucket.
Sign in to [Prefect Cloud](https://app.prefect.cloud/) to create a Prefect AWS credentials block and an S3 bucket block.

#### Configure an AWS IAM User
Follow the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_create.html) to create an IAM User with `AmazonS3FullAccess` permissions.

<Tip>
Save the **Access Key ID** and **Secret Access Key** - you'll need these to create a Prefect AWS credentials block.
</Tip>

#### Create an AWS S3 bucket
Follow the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/create-bucket-overview.html) to create an AWS S3 bucket.

<Tip>
Save the bucket name - you'll need this to create a Prefect S3 bucket block.
</Tip>

#### Create a Prefect AWS Credentials block
The Access Key ID and Secret Access Key from the IAM User can be stored in a Prefect AWS Credentials block. 
This Prefect block allows your flows and tasks to connect to your AWS resources.
You can create this block by using the Python SDK, or through the Prefect Cloud UI.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Python SDK method">
    Create a new python file in your project directory and add the following code:
{/* pmd-metadata: notest */}
```python
from prefect_aws import AwsCredentials


AwsCredentials(
    aws_access_key_id="PLACEHOLDER",  # Replace this with your access key id.
    aws_secret_access_key="PLACEHOLDER",  # Replace this with your secret access key.
    region_name="us-east-2"  # Replace this with your region.
).save("BLOCK-NAME-PLACEHOLDER")  # Replace this with a descriptive block name.

```
<Tip>
Make sure you have `prefect-aws` installed in your environment before running the script.

  </Tab>
</Tabs>



#### Create a Prefect S3 bucket block
S3 bucket blocks are used to store your S3 bucket configuration.
Your flows and tasks use this block to connect to your S3 bucket.
Similarly to the AWS credentials block, you can create this block by using the Python SDK or Prefect Cloud UI.


<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Python SDK method">
    Create a new python file in your project directory and add the following code:
{/* pmd-metadata: notest */}
```python
from prefect_aws import S3Bucket, AwsCredentials

aws_credentials = AwsCredentials.load("NAME-OF-YOUR-AWS-CREDENTIALS-BLOCK") #Replace this with your AWS credentials block name.

S3Bucket(
    bucket_name="YOUR-S3-BUCKET-NAME", #Replace this with your S3 bucket name.
    credentials=aws_credentials #Replace this with your AWS credentials block name.
).save("BLOCK-NAME-PLACEHOLDER") #Replace this with a descriptive block name.
```
<Tip>
Important: Make sure you have `prefect-aws` installed in your environment before running the script.

### Create a MotherDuck access token and secret block
This section will guide you through the process of creating a MotherDuck access token and a Prefect secret block to store the token.

#### Create a MotherDuck Access Token
Follow the [MotherDuck documentation](https://motherduck.com/docs/key-tasks/authenticating-and-connecting-to-motherduck/authenticating-to-motherduck/#authentication-using-an-access-token) to create an access token.

<Tip>
Save the token&mdash;you'll need this to create a Prefect Secret block.
</Tip>

#### Create a Prefect Secret block
Prefect secret blocks are used to store sensitive information, such as your MotherDuck access token. 
This secret block will allow your flows and tasks to connect to your MotherDuck database.
You can create a secret block by using the Python SDK or Prefect Cloud UI.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Python SDK method">
    Create a new python file in your project directory and add the following code:
{/* pmd-metadata: notest */}
```python
from prefect_secrets import Secret

Secret(
    value="YOUR-MOTHERDUCK-TOKEN", #Replace this with your motherduck access token.
    name="motherduck-access-token" #Replace this with a name that will help you identify the secret.
).save("BLOCK-NAME-PLACEHOLDER") #Replace this with a descriptive block name.
```

    <Arcade src={"https://demo.arcade.software/lkmbR08gd2qhoCqPtLGs"} title={"Create a Secret Block"} />
    
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Set up your project

Now that you have your Prefect blocks ready to go, it's time to create a new project directory and build your pipeline.

### Create a new project directory 
Create a new directory on your computer to store your project files. 
Within the root of the directory, create three subfolders for storing the pre- and post-processed game data, and a python file for your Prefect flow:
```
.
└── mlb-data-project/
    ├── mlb_flow.py
    ├── boxscore_parquet
    ├── raw_data
    └── boxscore_analysis
```

Run the following commands to create the project directory and files:
```bash
mkdir mlb-data-project
cd mlb-data-project
mkdir boxscore_parquet
mkdir raw_data
mkdir boxscore_analysis
touch mlb_flow.py
```

### Build the MLB pipeline
Once the project directory is set up, you can get to the fun part, building the MLB ETL pipeline!

#### Fetch the game data
First, import the necessary packages, and then create three tasks that fetch game data by using the [statsapi package](https://github.com/toddrob99/MLB-StatsAPI/tree/master?tab=readme-ov-file).
You'll also create a flow that calls these tasks and defines the dependencies between them.

<Expandable title="data ingestion tasks">
{/* pmd-metadata: notest */}
```python
from prefect import flow, task, runtime
from prefect.artifacts import create_markdown_artifact
from prefect_aws.s3 import S3Bucket
from prefect.blocks.system import Secret
from datetime import datetime
import statsapi
import json
import pandas as pd
import duckdb

@task
def get_recent_games(team_name, start_date, end_date):
    '''This task will fetch the schedule for the provided team and date range and return the game ids.'''
    team = statsapi.lookup_team(team_name)
    schedule = statsapi.schedule(team=team[0]["id"], start_date=start_date, end_date=end_date)
    for game in schedule:
        print(game['game_id'])
    return [game['game_id'] for game in schedule]


@task
def fetch_single_game_boxscore(game_id, start_date, end_date, team_name):
    '''This task will fetch the boxscore for a single game and return the game data.'''
    boxscore = statsapi.boxscore_data(game_id)
    
    # Extract the relevant data.
    home_score = boxscore['home']['teamStats']['batting']['runs']
    away_score = boxscore['away']['teamStats']['batting']['runs']
    home_team = boxscore['teamInfo']['home']['teamName']
    away_team = boxscore['teamInfo']['away']['teamName']
    time_value = next(item['value'] for item in boxscore['gameBoxInfo'] if item['label'] == 'T')
    
    #Create a dictionary with the game data.
    game_data = {
        'search_start_date': start_date,
        'search_end_date': end_date,
        'chosen_team_name': team_name,
        'game_id': game_id,
        'home_team': home_team,
        'away_team': away_team,
        'home_score': home_score,
        'away_score': away_score,
        'score_differential': abs(home_score - away_score),
        'game_time': time_value,
    }
    
    print(game_data)
    return game_data

@flow
def mlb_flow(team_name, start_date, end_date):
    # Get recent games.
    game_ids = get_recent_games(team_name, start_date, end_date)
    
    # Fetch boxscore for each game.
    game_data = [fetch_single_game_boxscore(game_id, start_date, end_date, team_name) for game_id in game_ids]
    
    #Define file path for raw data.
    today = datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d")  # This uses the current date in the format YYYY-MM-DD.
    flow_run_name = runtime.flow_run.name
    raw_file_path = f"./raw_data/{today}-{team_name}-{flow_run_name}-boxscore.json"
    
    # Save raw data to a local folder.
    save_raw_data_to_file(game_data, raw_file_path)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    mlb_flow("marlins", '06/01/2024', '06/30/2024')

```
</Expandable>

If you run this flow, you'll see the raw data saved to the `raw_data` folder in your project directory.

#### Loading data to S3
For the next two tasks, you'll upload the raw data file to s3, and pull it back down for further processing.
You'll need to add these new tasks to your flow function as well.
Copy and paste the following code into your `mlb_flow.py` file.

<Expandable title="S3 tasks">
{/* pmd-metadata: notest */}
```python

@task
def upload_raw_data_to_s3(file_path):
    '''This task will upload the raw data to s3.'''
    
    s3_bucket = S3Bucket.load("mlb-raw-data")  # Replace this with your S3 bucket block name.
    s3_bucket_path = s3_bucket.upload_from_path(file_path)
    
    print(s3_bucket_path)
    return s3_bucket_path
    

@task
def download_raw_data_from_s3(s3_file_path):
    '''Download the raw data from s3.'''
    
    s3_bucket = S3Bucket.load("mlb-raw-data")  # Replace this with your S3 bucket block name.
    local_file_path = f"./boxscore_analysis/{s3_file_path}"
    s3_bucket.download_object_to_path(s3_file_path, local_file_path)
    
    return local_file_path

```
</Expandable>

Update the `mlb_flow` function to include the new tasks.

<Expandable title="updated flow function">
{/* pmd-metadata: notest */}
```python
@flow
def mlb_flow(team_name, start_date, end_date):
    # Get recent games.
    game_ids = get_recent_games(team_name, start_date, end_date)
    
    # Fetch boxscore for each game.
    game_data = [fetch_single_game_boxscore(game_id, start_date, end_date, team_name) for game_id in game_ids]
    
    # Define file path for raw data.
    today = datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d")  # This uses the current date in the format YYYY-MM-DD.
    flow_run_name = runtime.flow_run.name
    raw_file_path = f"./raw_data/{today}-{team_name}-{flow_run_name}-boxscore.json"
    
    # Save raw data to a local folder.
    save_raw_data_to_file(game_data, raw_file_path)
    
    # Upload raw data to s3.
    s3_file_path = upload_raw_data_to_s3(raw_file_path)
    
    # Download raw data from s3.
    raw_data = download_raw_data_from_s3(s3_file_path)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    mlb_flow("marlins", '06/01/2024', '06/30/2024')


```
</Expandable>

Once you have your flow function updated, you can run the the script to see the data file arrive in your S3 bucket.

#### Define data processing and MotherDuck tasks
Create a set of functions that clean up the raw data, run some basic statistics, and save the results to a MotherDuck database.
Copy and paste the following code into your `mlb_flow.py` file.

<Expandable title="data processing and MotherDuck tasks">
{/* pmd-metadata: notest */}

        # Remove any non-digit, non-colon characters.
        game_data['game_time'] = ''.join(char for char in game_data['game_time'] if char.isdigit() or char == ':')
        
        hours, minutes = map(int, game_data['game_time'].split(':'))
