title: Extract data from websites
description: Use Prefect to fetch and analyze large amounts of data
---

In the [Build a data pipeline](/v3/tutorials/pipelines) tutorial, you learned how to create resilient and performant data pipelines.
Now you'll learn how to handle data dependencies and ingest large amounts of data by building a GitHub issue analysis pipeline.

The real world can present additional challenges when dealing with web data:

- API requests can fail or give a response with missing or malformed data.
- You need to make multiple dependent API calls.
- You need to ingest data when you don't know in advance how much data is available.

## Set up error handling

Throw and catch errors to handle them gracefully.
For example, if you don't get a 2xx response from an API, throw an exception and log the error.

```python
from typing import Optional

from prefect import task

@task(log_prints=True)
def fetch_page_of_issues(repo: str, page: int = 1) -> Optional[dict]:
    """Fetch a page of issues for a GitHub repository"""
    try:
        response = httpx.get(
            f"https://api.github.com/repos/{repo}/issues",
            params={"page": page, "state": "all", "per_page": 100}
        )
        response.raise_for_status() # Raise an exception if the response is not a 2xx status code
        return response.json()
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error fetching issues for {repo}: {e}")
        return None
```

<Expandable title="full example">
Run the following code to see error handling in action:

```python
from typing import List, Optional
import httpx

from prefect import flow, task


@flow(log_prints=True)
def analyze_repo_health(repos: List[str]):
    """Analyze issue health metrics for GitHub repositories"""
    for repo in repos:
        print(f"Analyzing {repo}...")
        
        # Fetch and analyze all issues
        fetch_page_of_issues(repo)


@task(log_prints=True)
def fetch_page_of_issues(repo: str, page: int = 1) -> Optional[dict]:
    """Fetch a page of issues for a GitHub repository"""
    try:
        response = httpx.get(
            f"https://api.github.com/repos/{repo}/issues",
            params={"page": page, "state": "all", "per_page": 100}
        )
        response.raise_for_status() # Raise an exception if the response is not a 2xx status code
        return response.json()
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error fetching issues for {repo}: {e}")
        return None


if __name__ == "__main__":
    analyze_repo_health([
        "PrefectHQ/prefect",
        "this-repo-does-not-exist/404" # This repo will trigger an error
    ])
```
</Expandable>

## Ingest large amounts of data

Use pagination to fetch large amounts of data and run tasks concurrently to analyze the data efficiently:

```python
from typing import List

from prefect import flow

@flow(log_prints=True)
def analyze_repo_health(repos: List[str]):
    """Analyze issue health metrics for GitHub repositories"""
    all_issues = []

    for repo in repos:
        for page in range(1, 3):  # Get first 2 pages
            issues = fetch_page_of_issues(repo, page)
            if not issues:
                break
            all_issues.extend(issues)
    
    # Run issue analysis tasks concurrently
    for issue in all_issues:
        analyze_issue.submit(issue) # Submit each task to a task runner
    
    # Wait for all analysis tasks to complete
    for detail in issue_details:
        result = detail.result() # Block until the task has completed
        print(f"Analyzed issue #{result['number']}")
```

<Expandable title="full example">
Run the following code to see pagination and concurrent tasks in action:

```python
from typing import List, Optional
import httpx

from prefect import flow, task


@flow(log_prints=True)
def analyze_repo_health(repos: List[str]):
    """Analyze issue health metrics for GitHub repositories"""
    for repo in repos:
        print(f"Analyzing {repo}...")
        
        # Fetch and analyze all issues
        fetch_repo_issues(repo)


@flow
def fetch_repo_issues(repo: str):
    """Fetch all issues for a single repository"""
    all_issues = []
    page = 1
    
    for page in range(1, 3):  # Limit to 2 pages to avoid hitting rate limits
        issues = fetch_page_of_issues(repo, page)
        if not issues or len(issues) == 0:
            break
        all_issues.extend(issues)
        page += 1

    issue_details = []
    for issue in all_issues[:5]:  # Limit to 5 issues to avoid hitting rate limits
        issue_details.append(
            fetch_issue_details.submit(repo, issue['number'])  # Submit each task to a task runner
        )
    
    details = []
    for issue in issue_details:
        details.append(issue.result())

    return details


@task(log_prints=True)
def fetch_page_of_issues(repo: str, page: int = 1) -> Optional[dict]:
    """Fetch a page of issues for a GitHub repository"""
    try:
        response = httpx.get(
            f"https://api.github.com/repos/{repo}/issues",
            params={"page": page, "state": "all", "per_page": 100}
        )
        response.raise_for_status()
        return response.json()
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error fetching issues for {repo}: {e}")
        return None


@task
def fetch_issue_details(repo: str, issue_number: int) -> dict:
    """Fetch detailed information about a specific issue"""
    response = httpx.get(f"https://api.github.com/repos/{repo}/issues/{issue_number}")
    issue_data = response.json()
    
    return issue_data

        "PrefectHQ/prefect",
        "pydantic/pydantic",
        "huggingface/transformers"
    ])
```

## Structure your code with dependent nested flows and tasks

Use nested flows and tasks to help distribute tasks more efficiently and aid with debugging.

* Use nested flows for more complex operations that involve multiple steps.
* Use tasks for simpler, atomic operations.

Here's an example of how to use nested flows and tasks:

```python
from typing import List

from prefect import flow, task


@flow
def analyze_repo_health(repos: List[str]):
    """Analyze issue health metrics for GitHub repositories"""
    for repo in repos:
        
        # Fetch and analyze all issues
        issues = fetch_repo_issues(repo)
        
        # Calculate metrics
        resolution_rate = calculate_resolution_rate(issues)
        # ...


@flow
def fetch_repo_issues(repo: str):
    """Nested flow: Fetch all data for a single repository"""

    # ...


@task
def calculate_resolution_rate(issues: List[dict]) -> float:
    """Task: Calculate the percentage of closed issues"""

    # ...
```

<Expandable title="full example">
Run the following code to see metrics calculation in action:

```python
from typing import List, Optional
import httpx

from prefect import flow, task


@flow(log_prints=True)
def analyze_repo_health(repos: List[str]):
    """Analyze issue health metrics for GitHub repositories"""
    for repo in repos:
        print(f"Analyzing {repo}...")
        
        # Fetch and analyze all issues
        issues = fetch_repo_issues(repo)
        
        # Calculate metrics
        resolution_rate = calculate_resolution_rate(issues)
        
        print(f"Resolution rate: {resolution_rate:.1f}%")


@flow
def fetch_repo_issues(repo: str):
    """Fetch all issues for a single repository"""
    all_issues = []
    page = 1
    
    for page in range(1, 3):  # Limit to 2 pages to avoid hitting rate limits
        issues = fetch_page_of_issues(repo, page)
        if not issues or len(issues) == 0:
            break
        all_issues.extend(issues)
        page += 1

    issue_details = []
    for issue in all_issues[:5]:  # Limit to 5 issues to avoid hitting rate limits
        issue_details.append(

        )
        response.raise_for_status()
        return response.json()

## Put it all together

Here's the complete flow that combines all of these components.
We'll also add retries, caching, and rate limiting to make the workflow more robust.

```python repo_analysis.py
from datetime import timedelta, datetime
from statistics import mean
from typing import List, Optional
import httpx

from prefect import flow, task
from prefect.tasks import task_input_hash
from prefect.concurrency.sync import rate_limit

        # Fetch and analyze all issues
        issues = fetch_repo_issues(repo)

        print(f"Average response time: {avg_response_time:.1f} hours")
        print(f"Resolution rate: {resolution_rate:.1f}%")


@flow

        if not issues or len(issues) == 0:
            break
        all_issues.extend(issues)
        page += 1

    for issue in all_issues[:5]:  # Limit to 5 issues to avoid hitting rate limits
        issue_details.append(
            fetch_issue_details.submit(repo, issue['number'])
        )
    
    details = []
    for issue in issue_details:
        details.append(issue.result())

    return details


@task(log_prints=True, retries=3, cache_key_fn=task_input_hash, cache_expiration=timedelta(hours=1))

            params={"page": page, "state": "all", "per_page": 100}
        )
        response.raise_for_status()
        return response.json()
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error fetching issues for {repo}: {e}")
        return None

        comments_data = issue.get('comments_data', [])
        if comments_data:  # If there are comments
            created = datetime.fromisoformat(issue['created_at'].replace('Z', '+00:00'))
            first_comment = datetime.fromisoformat(
                comments_data[0]['created_at'].replace('Z', '+00:00')
            )
            response_time = (first_comment - created).total_seconds() / 3600
            response_times.append(response_time)

    return mean(response_times) if response_times else 0


@task
def calculate_resolution_rate(issues: List[dict]) -> float:
    """Calculate the percentage of closed issues"""
    if not issues:
        return 0
    closed = sum(1 for issue in issues if issue['state'] == 'closed')
    return (closed / len(issues)) * 100


if __name__ == "__main__":
    analyze_repo_health([
        "PrefectHQ/prefect",
        "pydantic/pydantic",
        "huggingface/transformers"
    ])
```

Before running this code, make sure to set up the GitHub API rate limit:

```bash
# GitHub has a rate limit of 60 unauthenticated requests per hour (~0.016 requests per second)
prefect gcl create github-api --limit 60 --slot-decay-per-second 0.016
```

Run your analysis:

```bash
python repo_analysis.py
```

The output should look something like this:

```bash

## Next steps

In this tutorial, you built a complex data extraction pipeline which uses the following new techniques:

- Error recovery with try/catch blocks
- Modularized workflows with dependent [nested flows and tasks](/v3/develop/write-flows#nest-flows)
- Efficient ingestion and processing of large data with pagination and [concurrent tasks](/v3/develop/task-runners)

Next, learn how to use data to [train a machine learning model](/v3/tutorials/ml).
