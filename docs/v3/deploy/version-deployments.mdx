title: Version deployments
description: Track changes to your deployments and roll back to previous versions
---

In Prefect Cloud, deployments have a version history.
The **live** deployment version is the runnable version of a deployment.
A previous deployment version can be made live by **rolling back** to it.
When a previous deployment version is live, a newer deployment version can be made live by **promoting** it.

<Warning>
When a new version of a deployment is created, it is automatically set as the live version.
</Warning>

While the majority of deployment properties are included in a deployment's version, some properties cannot be versioned.
Persisting these properties across all versions helps prevent unexpected execution behavior when rolling back or promoting versions.

Additionally, Prefect automatically collects the **repository name**, **repository URL**, the currently checked out **branch**, the **commit SHA**, and the **first line of your commit message** from your environment if you're deploying from a supported version control platform or from inside a Git repository.
This information is used to help create a record of which code versions produced which deployment versions.

<Note>
Prefect's automatic version information collection currently supports Github Actions, Gitlab CI, Bitbucket Pipelines, and Azure Pipelines.

## Executing specific code versions

The presence of version information on a deployment does not override Prefect's deployment execution mechanics.
You must explicitly include information about your code version in either the **pull steps** or **job variables** of your deployment to keep code and deployment versions synchronized.
The required strategy differs depending on your chosen code storage type.

### Pulling from Git

The `git_clone` deployment pull step and `GitRepository` deployment storage class offer a `commit_sha` field.
When deploying from a Git repository, provide the commit SHA from your environment to your deployment.
Both approaches demonstrated below will result in a deployment pull step that clones your repository and checks out a specific commit.

<CodeGroup>

```yaml With prefect.yaml
pull:
- prefect.deployments.steps.git_clone:
    repository: https://github.com/<your-org>/<your-repo>.git
    commit_sha: "{{ $GITHUB_SHA }}"

deployments:
- name: my-deployment
  version: 0.0.1
  entrypoint: example.py:my_flow
  work_pool:
    name: my-work-pool
```

```python With .deploy()
import os

from prefect import flow
from prefect.runner.storage import GitRepository

@flow(log_prints=True)
def my_flow():
    print("Hello world!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    my_flow.from_source(
        source=GitRepository(
            repo_url="https://github.com/<your-org>/<your-repo>.git",
            commit_sha=os.getenv("GITHUB_SHA"),
        )
    ).deploy(
        name="my-deployment",
        version="0.0.1",
        work_pool_name="my-work-pool",
    )
```

</CodeGroup>


### Pulling Docker images

When baking code into Docker images, use the image digest to pin exact code versions to deployment versions.
An image digest uniquely and immutably identifies a container image.

First, build your image in your CI job and pass the image digest as an environment variable to the Prefect deploy step.

```bash Github Actions
    - name: Login to Docker Hub
      uses: docker/login-action@v3
      with:
        username: ${{ vars.DOCKERHUB_USERNAME }}
        password: ${{ secrets.DOCKERHUB_TOKEN }}

    - name: Set up Docker Buildx
      uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v3

    - name: Build and push
      uses: docker/build-push-action@v6
      with:
        push: true
        tags: user/app:latest

    - name: Prefect deploy
      env:
        IMAGE_DIGEST: ${{build and push.outputs.digest}}
      ...
        
```

Then, refer to that digest in the image name you provide to this deployment version's job variables.

<CodeGroup>

```yaml With prefect.yaml
deployments:
- name: my-deployment
  version: 0.0.1
  entrypoint: example.py:my_flow
  work_pool:
    name: my-work-pool
    job_variables:
      image: "my-image@{{ $IMAGE_DIGEST }}"
```

```python With .deploy()
import os

from prefect import flow
from prefect.runner.storage import GitRepository

@flow(log_prints=True)
def my_flow():
    print("Hello world!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    my_flow.deploy(
        name="my-deployment",
        version="0.0.1",
        work_pool_name="my-work-pool",
        image=f"my-image@{os.getenv('IMAGE_DIGEST')",
    )
```
