title: Version deployments
description: Track changes to your deployments and roll back to previous versions
---

In Prefect Cloud, deployments have a version history.
The **live** deployment version is the runnable version of a deployment.
A previous deployment version can be made live by **rolling back** to it.
When a previous deployment version is live, a newer deployment version can be made live by **promoting** it.

<Warning>
When a new version of a deployment is created, it is automatically set as the live version.
</Warning>

While the majority of deployment properties are included in a deployment's version, some properties cannot be versioned.
Persisting these properties across all versions helps prevent unexpected execution behavior when rolling back or promoting versions.

Additionally, Prefect automatically collects the **repository name**, **repository URL**, the currently checked out **branch**, the **commit SHA**, and the **first line of your commit message** from your environment if you're deploying from a supported version control platform or from inside a Git repository.
This information is used to help create a record of which code versions produced which deployment versions.

<Note>
Prefect's automatic version information collection currently supports Github Actions, Gitlab CI, Bitbucket Pipelines, and Azure Pipelines.

## Tying code versions to deployment versions

The presence of version information on a deployment does not override Prefect's deployment execution mechanics.
Depending on your chosen code storage location, you must explicitly include information about your code version in either the pull steps or job variables of your deployment to keep code and deployment versions synchronized.
