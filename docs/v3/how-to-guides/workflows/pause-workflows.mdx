### Pause a workflow run

To pause a flow run, use the `pause_flow_run` function.

```python
from prefect import task, flow, pause_flow_run, resume_flow_run

@task
async def marvin_setup():
    return "a raft of ducks walk into a bar..."


@task
async def marvin_punchline():
    return "it's a wonder none of them ducked!"


@flow
async def inspiring_joke():
    await marvin_setup()
    await pause_flow_run(timeout=600)  # pauses for 10 minutes
    await marvin_punchline()
```

Running this workflow will block execution until the workflow is resumed.

<Note>
**Timeouts**

Paused flow runs time out after one hour by default.
After the timeout, the flow run fails with a message saying it paused and never resumed.
Specify a different timeout period in seconds using the `timeout` parameter.
</Note>

### Resume a paused workflow run

Resume paused workflows by clicking **Resume** in the Prefect UI or calling the `resume_flow_run` utility through client code.

{/* pmd-metadata: notest */}
```python
from prefect import resume_flow_run

resume_flow_run(FLOW_RUN_ID)
```

### Suspend a workflow run

You can suspend a flow run to pause execution and tear down the execution environment while waiting for the workflow to be resumed.

To suspend a flow run, use the `suspend_flow_run` function.

```python
from prefect import flow, suspend_flow_run, task

@task(persist_result=True)
def foo():
    return 42

@flow(persist_result=True)
def noblock_pausing():
    x = foo.submit()
    suspend_flow_run(timeout=30)
    y = foo.submit()
    z = foo(wait_for=[x])
    alpha = foo(wait_for=[y])
    omega = foo(wait_for=[x, y])
```

<Warning>
**Suspended flow runs start from the beginning when resumed**

When the flow run resumes, it re-runs from the beginning of the flow. We recommend using [tasks](/v3/develop/write-tasks/) and [task caching](/v3/develop/task-caching) to avoid recomputing expensive operations when resuming a suspended flow run.
</Warning>

The flow run is marked as `Suspended` and will not resume until resumed via the UI or `resume_flow_run` is called.

<Note>
**Timeouts**

Suspended flow runs time out after one hour by default.
After the timeout, the flow run fails with a message saying it suspended and never resumed.
You can specify a different timeout period in seconds using the `timeout` parameter or pass `timeout=None` for no timeout.
</Note>

### Suspend a workflow run outside of the workflow

You can suspend flow runs out-of-process by calling `suspend_flow_run(flow_run_id=<ID>)` in another process or
selecting the **Suspend** button in the Prefect UI or Prefect Cloud.

<Note>

**You can't suspend subflows independently of their parent run**

If you use a flow to schedule a flow run with `run_deployment`, the
scheduled flow run is linked to the calling flow as a nested flow run by
default. This means you can't suspend the scheduled flow run
independently of the calling flow.

Call `run_deployment` with
`as_subflow=False` to disable this linking if you need to suspend
the scheduled flow run independently of the calling flow.
