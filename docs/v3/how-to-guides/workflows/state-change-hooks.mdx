### Available state change hooks

| Type | Flow | Task | Description |
| ----- | --- | --- | --- |
| `on_completion` | ✓ | ✓ | Executes when a flow or task run enters a `Completed` state. |
| `on_failure` | ✓ | ✓ | Executes when a flow or task run enters a `Failed` state. |
| <span class="no-wrap">`on_cancellation`</span> | ✓ | - | Executes when a flow run enters a `Cancelling` state. |
| `on_crashed` | ✓ | - | Executes when a flow run enters a `Crashed` state. |
| `on_running` | ✓ | - | Executes when a flow run enters a `Running` state. |

<Note>
Note that the `on_rollback` hook for tasks is _not_ a proper state change hook but instead
is a transaction lifecycle hook.
Rollback hooks accept one argument representing the transaction for the task.
</Note>

### Send a notification when a workflow run fails

To send a notification when a flow or task run fails, you can specify a `on_failure` hook.

```python
from prefect import flow
from prefect.blocks.core import Block
from prefect.settings import PREFECT_API_URL


@flow(retries=1)
def failing_flow():
    raise ValueError("oops!")


@failing_flow.on_failure
def notify_slack(flow, flow_run, state):
    slack_webhook_block = Block.load(
        "slack-webhook/my-slack-webhook"
    )

    slack_webhook_block.notify(
        (
            f"Your job {flow_run.name} entered {state.name} "
            f"with message:\n\n"
            f"See <https://{PREFECT_API_URL.value()}/flow-runs/"
            f"flow-run/{flow_run.id}|the flow run in the UI>\n\n"
            f"Tags: {flow_run.tags}\n\n"
            f"Scheduled start: {flow_run.expected_start_time}"
        )
    )

if __name__ == "__main__":
    failing_flow()
```

Retries are configured in this example, so the `on_failure` hook will not run until all `retries` have completed and the flow run enters a `Failed` state.

<Warning>
**State change hooks execute client side**

State change hooks run in the same process as your workflow and execution cannot be guaranteed. For more robust execution of logic in response to state changes, use an Automation.
</Warning>

### Pass `kwargs` to state change hooks

You can compose the `with_options` method to effectively pass arbitrary `**kwargs` to your hooks:

```python
from functools import partial
from prefect import flow, task

data = {}

def my_hook(task, task_run, state, **kwargs):
    data.update(state=state, **kwargs)

@task
def bad_task():
    raise ValueError("meh")

@flow
def ok_with_failure_flow(x: str = "foo", y: int = 42):
    bad_task_with_a_hook = bad_task.with_options(
        on_failure=[partial(my_hook, **dict(x=x, y=y))]
    )
    # return a tuple of "bar" and the task run state
    # to avoid raising the task's exception
    return "bar", bad_task_with_a_hook(return_state=True)

_, task_run_state = ok_with_failure_flow()

assert data == {"x": "foo", "y": 42, "state": task_run_state}
```
