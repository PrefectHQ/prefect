Use the `prefect.runtime` module to access runtime information from within a workflow.

```python
from prefect import flow
from prefect.runtime import flow_run


@flow
def moody_workflow(name: str):
    return f"I wish my parents had named me {name} instead of {flow_run.name}."
```

The value of `flow_run.name` will change between workflow runs to match the name of the flow run.

See the `prefect.runtime` module [reference](/v3/api-ref/python) for all available attributes.
