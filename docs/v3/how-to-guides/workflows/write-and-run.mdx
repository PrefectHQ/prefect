sidebarTitle: Write and run a workflow

Make a Python function a workflow by adding the `@flow` decorator to it:

```python
from prefect import flow


@flow
def my_workflow() -> str:
    return "Hello, world!"
```

Run the workflow by calling it like a normal Python function:

```python
my_workflow()
```

You can create a workflow from a method on a class:

```python
from prefect import flow


class MyClass:

    @flow
    def my_instance_method(self):
        return "Hello, from an instance method!"


    @flow
    @classmethod
    def my_class_method(cls):
        return "Hello, from a class method!"


    @flow
    @staticmethod
    def my_static_method():
        return "Hello, from a static method!"


MyClass().my_instance_method()
MyClass.my_class_method()
MyClass.my_static_method()
```

or from a generator function:

```python
from prefect import flow


@flow
def generator():
    for i in range(10):
        yield i


for val in generator():
    print(val)
```

You can view all workflow runs in the Prefect UI.

You can create tasks and child flows to organize your workflow logic.

```python
from prefect import flow, task


@task
def generate_a_number():
    return random.randint(0, 100)


@flow
def is_number_even(number: int):
    return number % 2 == 0


@flow
def even_or_odd():
    number = generate_a_number()
    if is_number_even(number):
        print("The number is even")
    else:
        print("The number is odd")
```

Each task and child flow is a separate unit of work and is displayed in the Prefect UI.
