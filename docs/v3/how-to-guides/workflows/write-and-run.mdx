Make a Python function a workflow by adding the `@flow` decorator to it:

```python
from prefect import flow


@flow
def my_workflow() -> str:
    return "Hello, world!"
```

Run the workflow by calling it like a normal Python function:

```python
my_workflow()
```

Workflows can be defined as methods on a class:

```python
from prefect import flow


class MyClass:

    @flow
    def my_instance_method(self):
        return "Hello, from an instance method!"


    @flow
    @classmethod
    def my_class_method(cls):
        return "Hello, from a class method!"


    @flow
    @staticmethod
    def my_static_method():
        return "Hello, from a static method!"


MyClass().my_instance_method()
MyClass.my_class_method()
MyClass.my_static_method()
```

Workflows can also be defined as generators:

```python
from prefect import flow


@flow
def generator():
    for i in range(10):
        yield i


for val in generator():
    print(val)
```

You can view all workflow runs in the Prefect UI.
