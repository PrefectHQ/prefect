## Calling tasks directly

Tasks can be called directly (i.e. using [`__call__`](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#object.__call__)), but they **will not** run concurrently.

```python
import time

from prefect import task

@task
def stop_at_floor(floor: int):
    print(f"elevator moving to floor {floor}")
    time.sleep(floor)
    print(f"elevator stops on floor {floor}")

stop_at_floor(0.1) # blocks for 0.1 seconds
stop_at_floor(0.2) # blocks for 0.2 seconds
stop_at_floor(0.3) # blocks for 0.3 seconds
```

When you call a task directly, it will block the main thread until the task completes.

Continue reading to learn how to run tasks concurrently via [task runners](/v3/concepts/task-runners).

## Using `.submit`

Tasks in your workflows can be run concurrently using the `.submit()` method. 

```python
import time

from prefect import flow, task
from prefect.futures import wait

@task
def stop_at_floor(floor: int):
    print(f"elevator moving to floor {floor}")
    time.sleep(floor)
    print(f"elevator stops on floor {floor}")

@flow
def elevator():
    floors = []
    for floor in range(10, 0, -1):
        floors.append(stop_at_floor.submit(floor))
    wait(floors)
```

By default, tasks are submitted via the `ThreadPoolTaskRunner`, which runs tasks concurrently in a thread pool.

<Warning>
A common mistake is to pass non-thread-safe objects to tasks that you submit to a task runner. Avoid passing non-thread-safe objects to tasks you intend to run concurrently.

See [Design Considerations](/v3/concepts/task-runners#design-considerations) for more information.
</Warning>


### Using a different task runner

To run submitted tasks with a different task runner, you can pass a `task_runner` argument to the `@flow` decorator.

<Note>
To run this example, you'll need to install the `prefect[dask]` extra
</Note>

```python
import time

from prefect import flow, task
from prefect.futures import wait
from prefect_dask.task_runners import DaskTaskRunner

@task
def stop_at_floor(floor: int):
    print(f"elevator moving to floor {floor}")
    time.sleep(floor)
    print(f"elevator stops on floor {floor}")

@flow(task_runner=DaskTaskRunner())
def elevator():
    floors = []
    for floor in range(10, 0, -1):
        floors.append(stop_at_floor.submit(floor))
    wait(floors)
```

### Handling futures

When you submit a task, you'll receive a `PrefectFuture` object back which you can use to track the task's execution. Use the `.result()` method to get the result of the task.

```python
from prefect import task, flow

@task
def cool_task():
    return "sup"
    
@flow
def my_workflow():
    future = cool_task.submit()
    result = future.result()
    print(result)
```

If you don't need to the result of the task, you can use the `.wait()` method to wait for execution to complete.

```python
from prefect import task, flow

@task
def cool_task():
    return "sup"
    
@flow
def my_workflow():
    future = cool_task.submit()
    future.wait()
```

To wait for multiple futures to complete, use the `wait()` utility.

```python
from prefect import task, flow
from prefect.futures import wait


@task
def cool_task():
    return "sup"
    
    
@flow
def my_workflow():
    futures = [cool_task.submit() for _ in range(10)]
    wait(futures)
```

<Tip>
**Passing futures between tasks**

If you pass `PrefectFuture` objects between tasks or flows, the task or flow receiving the future will wait for the future to complete before starting execution.

```python
from prefect import task, flow

@task
def cool_task():
    return "sup"


@task
def what_did_cool_task_say(what_it_said: str):
    return f"cool task said {what_it_said}"

@flow
def my_workflow():
    future = cool_task.submit()
    print(what_did_cool_task_say(future))
```
</Tip>

## Using `.map`

For a convenient way to iteratively submit tasks, use the `.map()` method.

```python
import time

from prefect import flow, task
from prefect.futures import wait

@task
def stop_at_floor(floor: int):
    print(f"elevator moving to floor {floor}")
    time.sleep(floor)
    print(f"elevator stops on floor {floor}")

@flow
def elevator():
    floors = list(range(10, 0, -1))
    floors = stop_at_floor.map(floors)
    wait(floors)
```

Like `.submit`, `.map` uses the task runner configured on the parent flow. Changing the task runner will change where mapped tasks are executed.


### Using the `unmapped` annotation

Sometimes you may not want to map a task over a certain input value.

By default, non-iterable values will not be mapped over (so `unmapped` is not required):

```python
from prefect import flow, task

@task
def add_together(x, y):
    return x + y

@flow
def sum_it(numbers: list[int], static_value: int):
    futures = add_together.map(numbers, static_value)
    return futures.result()

resulting_sum = sum_it([1, 2, 3], 5)
assert resulting_sum == [6, 7, 8]
```

... but if your argument is an iterable type, wrap it with `unmapped` to tell `.map` to treat it 
as static:

```python
from prefect import flow, task, unmapped

@task
def sum_plus(x, static_iterable):
    return x + sum(static_iterable)

@flow
def sum_it(numbers, static_iterable):
    futures = sum_plus.map(numbers, unmapped(static_iterable))
    return futures.result()

resulting_sum = sum_it([4, 5, 6], [1, 2, 3])
assert resulting_sum == [10, 11, 12]
```


### Bulk `PrefectFuture` operations

When using `.map` as in the above example, the result of the task is a list of futures.

You can wait for or retrieve the results from these futures with `wait` or `result` methods:

{/* pmd-metadata: notest */}
```python
futures = some_task.map(some_iterable)
results = futures.result()
```
which is syntactic sugar for the corresponding list comprehension:

{/* pmd-metadata: notest */}
```python
futures = some_task.map(some_iterable)
results = [future.result() for future in futures]
```

### Nested mapped tasks

To model more complex concurrent workflows, you can map tasks within other tasks:

```python {16}
import re

from prefect import flow, task
from prefect.futures import wait

def count_words(text: str) -> int:
    """Count the number of words in a text."""
    return len(text.split())

def extract_emails(text: str) -> list[str]:
    return re.findall(r"[\w.+-]+@[\w-]+\.[\w.-]+", text)

@task
def analyze_texts(texts: list[str]) -> dict[str, list[int | list[str]]]:
    futures = {
        op.__name__: task(op).map(texts) for op in [count_words, extract_emails]
    }
    wait([f for futs in futures.values() for f in futs])
    return {name: [f.result() for f in futs] for name, futs in futures.items()}

@flow
def run_text_analysis():
    """Analyze a batch of social media posts with multiple operations."""
    results = analyze_texts(
        texts=[
            "Just visited #Paris! Contact me at visitor@example.com #travel #vacation",
            "Working on my new #project. Reach out at developer@example.com if interested!",
            "Happy to announce our company event #celebration #milestone email: events@company.org",
        ]
    )
    print("\nAnalysis Results:")
    print(f"  Word counts: {results['count_words']}")
    print(f"  Extracted emails: {results['extract_emails']}\n")
    return results

run_text_analysis()
```

This pattern is useful when you need to:
1. Process combinations of parameters concurrently
2. Apply multiple transformations to multiple datasets
3. Create a grid of operations where each cell is an independent task


## Creating state dependencies

You may also use the [`wait_for=[]`](https://reference.prefect.io/prefect/tasks/#prefect.tasks.Task.submit) parameter 
when calling a task by specifying upstream task dependencies. This enables you to control task execution 
order for tasks that do not share data dependencies.

```python
from prefect import flow, task
@task
def task_a():
    pass

@task
def task_b():
    pass

@task
def task_c():
    pass
    
@task
def task_d():
    pass

@flow
def my_flow():
    a = task_a.submit()
    b = task_b.submit()
    # Wait for task_a and task_b to complete
    c = task_c.submit(wait_for=[a, b])
    # task_d will wait for task_c to complete
    # Note: If waiting for one task it must still be in a list.
    d = task_d(wait_for=[c])
```


## Using `asyncio`

If you have tasks are defined as async functions, you can use `asyncio` from the Python standard library to run them concurrently.

```python
import asyncio

from prefect import flow, task

@task
async def stop_at_floor(floor: int):
    print(f"elevator moving to floor {floor}")
    await asyncio.sleep(floor)
    print(f"elevator stops on floor {floor}")

@flow
async def elevator():
    floors = list(range(10, 0, -1))
    await asyncio.gather(*[stop_at_floor(floor) for floor in floors])


if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(elevator())
```


## Real-world applications

Mapped tasks are particularly valuable in common data science and ETL workflows such as:

1. **Machine learning model evaluation**: Train multiple models on multiple datasets concurrently
2. **ETL pipelines**: Process multiple data sources with multiple transformations
3. **API data enrichment**: Enrich multiple records with data from multiple external services

For example, imagine you want to find the best training configuration for a series of datasets, and you want to process all datasets concurrently:

```python
import random
from dataclasses import dataclass

from prefect import flow, task
from prefect.futures import PrefectFuture, wait

@dataclass
class Dataset:
    name: str

@dataclass
class ModelConfig:
    name: str

@task(task_run_name="train on {dataset.name} with {model_config.name}")
def train_model(dataset: Dataset, model_config: ModelConfig) -> dict:
    return {
        "dataset": dataset.name,
        "model": model_config.name,
        "score": random.random(),
    }

@flow
def evaluate_models(datasets: list[Dataset], model_configs: list[ModelConfig]):
    all_futures: list[PrefectFuture[dict[str, object]]] = []
    for dataset in datasets:
        futures = train_model.map(
            dataset=dataset,
            model_config=model_configs,
        )
        all_futures.extend(futures)

    results = [future.result() for future in wait(all_futures).done]

    print(f"\nBest model: {max(results, key=lambda r: r['score'])}")

evaluate_models(
    datasets=[
        Dataset("customers"), Dataset("products"), Dataset("orders")
    ],
    model_configs=[
        ModelConfig("random_forest"), ModelConfig("gradient_boosting")
    ],
)
```
