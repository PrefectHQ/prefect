To rerun your workflow when an exception is raised, set the `retries` parameter to an integer.

```python
from prefect import flow


@flow(retries=3)
def troublesome_workflow():
    raise Exception("oopsie daisy")
```

To add a wait between retries, pass a value to the `retry_delay_seconds` parameter.

```python
from prefect import flow


@flow(retries=3, retry_delay_seconds=2.7182)
def troublesome_workflow():
    raise Exception("oopsie daisy")
```
