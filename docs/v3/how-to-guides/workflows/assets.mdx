Assets in Prefect represent important outputs (such as data) that are produced by your tasks and flows. Assets can reference virtually any output such as files, dataframes, tables, dashboards, or ML models. By using the `@materialize` decorator, you can track when your workflows create, update, or reference these objects.

## Basic asset materialization

Use the `@materialize` decorator to mark functions that create or update assets. This decorator wraps your function similar to `@task` but specifically tracks asset creation:

```python
from prefect import flow
from prefect.assets import materialize

@materialize("s3://my-bucket/processed-data.csv")
def process_data(data: dict) -> dict:
    # Your data processing logic here
    # save_to_s3(data, "s3://my-bucket/processed-data.csv")
    return data

@flow
def data_pipeline(data: dict):
    process_data(data)
```

Asset keys must be valid URIs that uniquely identify your workflow outputs. Assets are automatically grouped by type (specified by the URI prefix) and can be nested based on the URI path structure. For example, `s3://` assets are grouped separately from `postgres://` assets, and nested paths like `s3://bucket/team-a/data.csv` and `s3://bucket/team-b/data.csv` create hierarchical organization.

<Note>
**`@materialize` wraps `@task`**: the `@materialize` decorator accepts all keyword arguments and configuration that the `@task` decorator accepts and can be used as a drop-in replacement.
</Note>

## Asset dependencies 

### Inferred from task graphs

Prefect automatically infers asset dependencies from your task graph. When materialized assets flow through your workflow, downstream materializations inherit these dependencies:

```python
from prefect import flow
from prefect.assets import materialize


@materialize("file://my-local-directory/raw-data.csv")
def extract_data() -> str:
    raw_data = "name,age\nchris,21"
    with open("raw-data.csv", "w") as f:
        f.write(raw_data)
    return raw_data


@materialize("s3://my-bucket/clean-data.csv")
def transform_data(raw_data):
    # saves raw_data to s3
    pass


@flow
def etl_pipeline():
    raw_data = extract_data()
    transform_data(raw_data)  # Automatically depends on raw-data.csv
```

Running this flow produces the following asset graph:

### External and cross-flow asset dependencies

Use `asset_deps` to reference assets that are external to your current workflow. This creates dependencies on assets that may be materialized by other flows, external systems, or manual processes:

```python
from prefect import flow
from prefect.assets import materialize


# Depends on asset from another Prefect flow
@materialize(
    "s3://my-bucket/downstream-data.csv",
    asset_deps=["s3://my-bucket/upstream-data.csv"]  # From different flow
)
def process_downstream_data():
    pass

# Depends on external system assets
@materialize(
    "s3://my-bucket/enriched-data.csv",
    asset_deps=[
        "postgres://db/users_table",      # External database
        "sftp://vendor/daily-feed.csv"    # External data feed
    ]
)
def enrich_user_data():
    pass

@flow
def analytics_pipeline():
    process_downstream_data()
    enrich_user_data()
```

Running this flow produces the following asset graph:

This approach allows you to model your complete data ecosystem, tracking dependencies even when some assets are managed outside your current workflow or outside Prefect entirely.

## Multiple asset materialization

Materialize multiple related assets in a single function when they share the same upstream dependencies:

```python
from prefect.assets import materialize


@materialize(
    "s3://my-bucket/summary.csv",
    "s3://my-bucket/details.csv"
)
def generate_reports():
    data = fetch_source_data()
    create_summary_report(data)
    create_detailed_report(data)
```
