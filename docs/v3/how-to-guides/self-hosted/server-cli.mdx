The [Prefect CLI](/v3/get-started/install) is the easiest way to start a local instance of Prefect server.

## Start the server

1. Spin up a self-hosted Prefect server instance UI with the `prefect server start` CLI command in the terminal:

```bash
prefect server start
```

2. Open the URL for the Prefect server UI ([http://127.0.0.1:4200](http://127.0.0.1:4200) by default) in a browser.

3. Shut down the Prefect server with ctrl  +  c in the terminal.

## Configure the server

Go to your terminal session and run this command to set the API URL to point to a self-hosted Prefect server instance:

```bash
prefect config set PREFECT_API_URL="http://127.0.0.1:4200/api"
```

You can save the API server address in a Prefect profile. 
Whenever that profile is active, the API endpoint is at that address.
See [Profiles and configuration](/v3/develop/settings-and-profiles/) for more information on profiles and configurable Prefect settings.

## Database configuration

### Use SQLite (default)

By default, Prefect uses a SQLite database stored at `~/.prefect/prefect.db`. No additional configuration is needed for basic use.

### Use PostgreSQL

To use PostgreSQL as your database backend:

1. Set the database connection URL:

```bash
prefect config set PREFECT_API_DATABASE_CONNECTION_URL="postgresql+asyncpg://postgres:yourTopSecretPassword@localhost:5432/prefect"
```

2. Start the server:

```bash
prefect server start
```

For more database configuration options, see the [database settings reference](/v3/api-ref/settings-ref#database).

## Database management commands

### Reset the database

Clear all data and reapply the schema:

```bash
prefect server database reset -y
```

### Manage migrations

Apply database migrations:

```bash
# Upgrade to the latest version
prefect server database upgrade -y

# Downgrade to the previous version
prefect server database downgrade -y -r -1

# Downgrade to a specific revision
prefect server database downgrade -y -r d20618ce678e
```

For large databases, you may need to increase the timeout:

```bash
export PREFECT_API_DATABASE_TIMEOUT=600
prefect server database upgrade -y
```

## Advanced configuration

For advanced deployment scenarios including:
- Running behind a reverse proxy
- Configuring SSL certificates
- Multi-server deployments
- Handling migration issues
