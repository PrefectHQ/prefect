Prefect Cloud's [Enterprise plans](https://www.prefect.io/pricing) offer single sign-on (SSO) integration with your team's identity provider.
You can set up SSO integration with any identity provider that supports:

- OIDC
- SAML 2.0

When using SSO, Prefect Cloud won't store passwords for any accounts managed by your identity provider.
Members of your Prefect Cloud account will log in and authenticate using your identity provider.

Once your SSO integration is set up, non-admins are required to authenticate through the SSO provider when 
accessing account resources.

See the [Prefect Cloud plans](https://www.prefect.io/pricing) to learn more about options for supporting more users and 
workspaces, service accounts, and SSO.

## Configure SSO

Within your account, select the **SSO** page to enable SSO for users.

If you haven't enabled SSO for a domain yet, enter the email domains for enabling SSO in Prefect Cloud, and save it.

Under **Enabled Domains**, select the domains from the **Domains** list, then select **Generate Link**. 
This step creates a link to configure SSO with your identity provider.


Using the provided link, navigate to the Identity Provider Configuration dashboard and select your identity provider to continue 
configuration. If your provider isn't listed, try `SAML` or `Open ID Connect` instead.

Once you complete SSO configuration, your users must authenticate through your identity provider when accessing account resources, giving you full control over application access.

## Directory sync

**Directory sync** automatically provisions and de-provisions users for your account.

Provisioned users are given basic “Member” roles and have access to any resources that role entails.

When a user is unassigned from the Prefect Cloud application in your identity provider, they automatically lose access to 
Prefect Cloud resources. This allows your IT team to control access to Prefect Cloud without signing into the Prefect UI.

## SCIM Provisioning

Enterprise plans have access to SCIM (System for Cross-domain Identity Management) for automated user and team provisioning.

SCIM enables automatic provisioning and de-provisioning of users and teams based on your identity provider's directory.
When users are added, removed, or have their group memberships changed in your identity provider, these changes are
automatically reflected in Prefect Cloud.

### Enable SCIM provisioning

The SSO tab provides access to enable SCIM provisioning for your account.

### Role mapping

SCIM supports role mapping, which allows you to automatically assign Prefect Cloud account roles based on directory
group memberships configured in your identity provider.

#### Account roles

Directory groups can be mapped to the following Prefect Cloud account roles:

- **Owner**: Full account control including billing and account management
- **Admin**: Account management capabilities, can invite users and manage workspaces
- **Member**: Basic account access with workspace-level permissions
- **Collaborator**: Limited account access, typically for external users

#### Configure role mapping

Role mapping is configured in your WorkOS organization dashboard:

1. Navigate to your WorkOS dashboard
2. Select your organization
3. Go to Directory Sync settings
4. Click "Configure role assignment"
5. Map your identity provider groups to Prefect Cloud roles

When role mapping is configured:
- New users automatically receive the appropriate role based on their group memberships
- Users with multiple group memberships receive the role with the highest priority
- Users not in any mapped group receive the default "Member" role
- Role changes in your identity provider are reflected in Prefect Cloud automatically

#### Team management

Directory groups are automatically synchronized as teams in Prefect Cloud. See [Teams](/v3/how-to-guides/cloud/manage-users/manage-teams/)
for more information about SCIM team management.

### Supported operations

SCIM provisioning supports the following operations:
- **User provisioning**: Automatic creation and updates of user accounts
- **User deprovisioning**: Automatic removal of user access when removed from the directory
- **Group/team synchronization**: Automatic creation and management of teams based on directory groups
- **Role assignment**: Automatic role assignment based on group memberships
