Prefect Cloud's [Pro and Enterprise plans](https://www.prefect.io/pricing) offer enhanced compliance and transparency through audit logs.
Audit logs provide a chronological record of activities performed by members in your account, 
allowing you to monitor detailed Prefect Cloud actions for security and compliance purposes.

Audit logs show who took what action, when, and using what resources within your Prefect Cloud account.
In conjunction with appropriate tools and procedures, audit logs assist in detecting 
potential security violations and investigating application errors.  

Audit logs record:

- Access to workspaces
- User login activity
- User API key creation and removal
- Workspace creation and removal
- Account member invitations and removal
- Service account creation, API key rotation, and removal
- Billing payment method for self-serve pricing tiers

## View audit logs

From your account settings page, select the **Audit Log** page to view audit logs.
Administrators can view audit logs for:

- Account-level events in Prefect Cloud, such as:
  - Member invites
  - Changing a member's role
  - Member login and logout of Prefect Cloud
  - Creating or deleting a service account
- Workspace-level events in Prefect Cloud, such as:
  - Adding a member to a workspace
  - Changing a member's workspace role
  - Creating or deleting a workspace

Admins can filter audit logs on multiple dimensions to restrict the results they see by workspace, user, or event type.
View audit log events in the **Events** drop-down menu.

You may also filter audit logs by date range. 
Audit log retention period varies by [Prefect Cloud plan](https://www.prefect.io/pricing).
