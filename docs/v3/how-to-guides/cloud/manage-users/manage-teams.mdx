Prefect Cloud's [Enterprise plan](https://www.prefect.io/pricing) offers team management to simplify access control governance.

Account Admins can configure teams and team membership from the account settings menu by clicking **Teams**.
Teams are composed of users and service accounts.
Teams can be added to workspaces or object access control lists just like users and service accounts.

## SCIM team management

If SCIM is enabled on your account, teams and team memberships are automatically managed by your identity provider.

### Automatic team creation

When SCIM is enabled:
- Directory groups from your identity provider are automatically synchronized as teams in Prefect Cloud
- Teams are created with the same name as the directory group
- Team names are updated automatically if changed in the identity provider

### Automatic membership management

Team memberships are automatically managed based on directory group memberships:
- Users added to a directory group automatically become team members in Prefect Cloud
- Users removed from a directory group automatically lose team membership
- Changes are synchronized in real-time when your identity provider sends SCIM events

### Service accounts

Prefect Cloud service accounts are not governed by your identity provider and can still be manually added to teams.
Service accounts provide a way to access Prefect Cloud programmatically without requiring individual user credentials.


See the [Prefect Cloud plans](https://www.prefect.io/pricing) to learn more about options for supporting teams.
