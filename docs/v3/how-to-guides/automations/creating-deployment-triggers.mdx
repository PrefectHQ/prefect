## Creating deployment triggers

To enable the simple configuration of event-driven deployments, Prefect provides **deployment triggers**â€”a shorthand for
creating automations that are linked to specific deployments to run them based on the presence or absence of events.

<Info>
Deployment triggers are a special case of automations where the configured action is always running a deployment.
</Info>

Trigger definitions for deployments are supported in `prefect.yaml`, `.serve`, and `.deploy`. At deployment time,
specified trigger definitions create linked automations triggered by events matching your chosen
[grammar](/v3/concepts/events/#event-grammar). Each trigger definition may include a [jinja template](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jinja_(template_engine))
to render the triggering `event` as the `parameters` of your  deployment's flow run.

### Define triggers in `prefect.yaml`

You can include a list of triggers on any deployment in a `prefect.yaml` file:

```yaml
deployments:
  - name: my-deployment
    entrypoint: path/to/flow.py:decorated_fn
    work_pool:
      name: my-work-pool
    triggers:
      - type: event
        enabled: true
        match:
          prefect.resource.id: my.external.resource
        expect:
          - external.resource.pinged
        parameters:
          param_1: "{{ event }}"
```

This deployment creates a flow run when an `external.resource.pinged` event _and_ an `external.resource.replied`
event have been seen from `my.external.resource`:

```yaml
deployments:
  - name: my-deployment
    entrypoint: path/to/flow.py:decorated_fn
    work_pool:
      name: my-work-pool
    triggers:
      - type: compound
        require: all
        parameters:
          param_1: "{{ event }}"
        triggers:
          - type: event
            match:
              prefect.resource.id: my.external.resource
            expect:
              - external.resource.pinged
          - type: event
            match:
              prefect.resource.id: my.external.resource
            expect:
              - external.resource.replied
```

### Define deployment triggers using Terraform

You can also set up a deployment trigger via Terraform resources, specifically via the `prefect_automation` [resource](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/PrefectHQ/prefect/latest/docs/resources/automation).

```hcl
resource "prefect_deployment" "my_deployment" {
  name            = "my-deployment"
  work_pool_name  = "my-work-pool"
  work_queue_name = "default"
  entrypoint      = "path/to/flow.py:decorated_fn"
}

resource "prefect_automation" "event_trigger" {
  name = "my-automation"
  trigger = {
    event = {
      posture   = "Reactive"
      expect    = ["external.resource.pinged"]
      threshold = 1
      within    = 0
    }
  }
  actions = [
    {
      type          = "run-deployment"
      source        = "selected"
      deployment_id = prefect_deployment.my_deployment.id
      parameters = jsonencode({
        "param_1" : "{{ event }}"
      })
    },
  ]
}

```


### Define triggers in `.serve` and `.deploy`

To create deployments with triggers in Python, the trigger types `DeploymentEventTrigger`,
`DeploymentMetricTrigger`, `DeploymentCompoundTrigger`, and `DeploymentSequenceTrigger` can be imported
from `prefect.events`:

```python
from prefect import flow
from prefect.events import DeploymentEventTrigger


@flow(log_prints=True)
def decorated_fn(param_1: str):
    print(param_1)


if __name__=="__main__":
    decorated_fn.serve(
        name="my-deployment",
        triggers=[
            DeploymentEventTrigger(
                enabled=True,
                match={"prefect.resource.id": "my.external.resource"},
                expect=["external.resource.pinged"],
                parameters={
                    "param_1": "{{ event }}",
                },
            )
        ],
    )
```

As with prior examples, you must supply composite triggers with a list of underlying triggers:

```python
from prefect import flow
from prefect.events import DeploymentCompoundTrigger


@flow(log_prints=True)
def decorated_fn(param_1: str):
    print(param_1)


if __name__=="__main__":
    decorated_fn.deploy(
        name="my-deployment",
        image="my-image-registry/my-image:my-tag",
        triggers=[
            DeploymentCompoundTrigger(
                enabled=True,
                name="my-compound-trigger",
                require="all",
                triggers=[
                    {
                      "type": "event",
                      "match": {"prefect.resource.id": "my.external.resource"},
                      "expect": ["external.resource.pinged"],
                    },
                    {
                      "type": "event",
                      "match": {"prefect.resource.id": "my.external.resource"},
                      "expect": ["external.resource.replied"],
                    },
                ],
                parameters={
                    "param_1": "{{ event }}",
                },
            )
        ],
        work_pool_name="my-work-pool",
    )
```


### Pass triggers to `prefect deploy`

You can pass one or more `--trigger` arguments to `prefect deploy` as either a JSON string or a
path to a `.yaml` or `.json` file.

```bash
# Pass a trigger as a JSON string
prefect deploy -n test-deployment \
  --trigger '{
    "enabled": true,
    "match": {
      "prefect.resource.id": "prefect.flow-run.*"
    },
    "expect": ["prefect.flow-run.Completed"]
  }'

# Pass a trigger using a JSON/YAML file
prefect deploy -n test-deployment --trigger triggers.yaml
prefect deploy -n test-deployment --trigger my_stuff/triggers.json
```

For example, a `triggers.yaml` file could have many triggers defined:

```yaml
triggers:
  - enabled: true
    match:
      prefect.resource.id: my.external.resource
    expect:
      - external.resource.pinged
    parameters:
      param_1: "{{ event }}"
  - enabled: true
    match:
      prefect.resource.id: my.other.external.resource
    expect:
      - some.other.event
    parameters:
      param_1: "{{ event }}"
```

Both of the above triggers would be attached to `test-deployment` after running `prefect deploy`.

<Warning>
**Triggers passed to `prefect deploy` will override any triggers defined in `prefect.yaml`**

While you can define triggers in `prefect.yaml` for a given deployment, triggers passed to `prefect deploy`
take precedence over those defined in `prefect.yaml`.
</Warning>

Note that deployment triggers contribute to the total number of automations in your workspace.
