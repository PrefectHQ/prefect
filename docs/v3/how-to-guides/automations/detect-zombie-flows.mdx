### Detect and respond to zombie flows

If the infrastructure a flow is running on suddenly fails (for example, the machine crashes or a container is evicted),
Prefect's orchestration engine will be unable to report state changes and the flow run will get stuck in the running state.

Fortunately, flow runs triggered via deployment can emit heartbeats as they are running, and a Prefect automation can update
a flow run's state to crashed if the server stops receiving heartbeats for that flow run.

<Note>
**Enable flow run heartbeat events**

You will need to ensure you're running Prefect version 3.1.8 or greater and set `PREFECT_RUNNER_HEARTBEAT_FREQUENCY`
to an integer greater than 30 to emit flow run heartbeat events.
</Note>

To create an automation that marks zombie flow runs as crashed, run this script:
```python
from datetime import timedelta

from prefect.automations import Automation
from prefect.client.schemas.objects import StateType
from prefect.events.actions import ChangeFlowRunState
from prefect.events.schemas.automations import EventTrigger, Posture
from prefect.events.schemas.events import ResourceSpecification


my_automation = Automation(
    name="Crash zombie flows",
    trigger=EventTrigger(
        after={"prefect.flow-run.heartbeat"},
        expect={
            "prefect.flow-run.heartbeat",
            "prefect.flow-run.Completed",
            "prefect.flow-run.Failed",
            "prefect.flow-run.Cancelled",
            "prefect.flow-run.Crashed",
        },
        match=ResourceSpecification({"prefect.resource.id": ["prefect.flow-run.*"]}),
        for_each={"prefect.resource.id"},
        posture=Posture.Proactive,
        threshold=1,
        within=timedelta(seconds=90),
    ),
    actions=[
        ChangeFlowRunState(
            state=StateType.CRASHED,
            message="Flow run marked as crashed due to missing heartbeats.",
        )
    ],
)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    my_automation.create()
```

The trigger definition says after each heartbeat event for a flow run we expect to see another heartbeat event or a
terminal state event for that same flow run within 90 seconds of a heartbeat event.

If `PREFECT_RUNNER_HEARTBEAT_FREQUENCY` is set to `30`, the automation will trigger only after 3 heartbeats have been missed.
You can adjust `within` in the trigger definition and `PREFECT_RUNNER_HEARTBEAT_FREQUENCY` to change how quickly the automation
will fire after the server stops receiving flow run heartbeats.

You can also add additional actions to your automation to send a notification when zombie runs are detected.
