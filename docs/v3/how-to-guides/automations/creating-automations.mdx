## Create an automation

On the **Automations** page, select the **+** icon to create a new automation. You'll be prompted to configure:

- A [trigger](#triggers) condition that causes the automation to execute.
- One or more [actions](#actions) carried out by the automation.
- [Details](#details) about the automation, such as a name and description.

### Create automations with the CLI

You can create automations from YAML or JSON files using the Prefect CLI:

```bash
# Create from a YAML file
prefect automation create automation.yaml

# Create from a JSON file  
prefect automation create automation.json

# Create from a JSON string
prefect automation create '{"name": "my-automation", "trigger": {...}, "actions": [...]}'
```

Here's an example YAML file that creates an automation to cancel long-running flows:

```yaml
name: Cancel Long Running Flows
description: Cancels flows running longer than 5 minutes
enabled: true
trigger:
  type: event
  posture: Reactive
  match_state_name: RUNNING
  match_state_duration_s: 300  # 5 minutes
actions:
  - type: cancel-flow-run
```

### Create automations with the Python SDK

You can create and access any automation with the Python SDK's `Automation` class and its methods.
```python
from prefect.automations import Automation
from prefect.events.schemas.automations import EventTrigger
from prefect.events.actions import CancelFlowRun

# creating an automation
automation = Automation(
    name="woodchonk",
    trigger=EventTrigger(
        expect={"animal.walked"},
        match={
            "genus": "Marmota",
            "species": "monax",
        },
        posture="Reactive",
        threshold=3,
    ),
    actions=[CancelFlowRun()],
).create()

# reading the automation
automation = Automation.read(id=automation.id)
# or by name
automation = Automation.read(name="woodchonk")
```
