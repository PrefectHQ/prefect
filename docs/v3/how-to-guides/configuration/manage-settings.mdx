### View current configuration

To view all available settings and their active values from the command line, run:

```bash
prefect config view --show-defaults
```

These settings are type-validated and you may verify your setup at any time with:

```bash
prefect config validate
```

### Configure settings for the active profile

To update a setting for the active profile, run:

```bash
prefect config set <setting>=<value>
```

For example, to set the `PREFECT_API_URL` setting to `http://127.0.0.1:4200/api`, run:

```bash
prefect config set PREFECT_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:4200/api
```

To restore the default value for a setting, run:

```bash
prefect config unset <setting>
```

For example, to restore the default value for the `PREFECT_API_URL` setting, run:

```bash
prefect config unset PREFECT_API_URL
```

### Create a new profile

To create a new profile, run:

```bash
prefect profile create <profile>
```

To switch to a new profile, run:

```bash
prefect profile use <profile>
```

### Configure settings for a project

To configure settings for a project, create a `prefect.toml` or `.env` file in the project directory and add the settings with the values you want to use.

For example, to configure the `PREFECT_API_URL` setting to `http://127.0.0.1:4200/api`, create a `.env` file with the following content:

```bash
PREFECT_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:4200/api
```

To configure the `PREFECT_API_URL` setting to `http://127.0.0.1:4200/api` in a `prefect.toml` file, create a `prefect.toml` file with the following content:

```bash
api.url = "http://127.0.0.1:4200/api"
```

Refer to the [setting concept guide](/v3/concepts/settings-and-profiles/) for more information on how to configure settings and the [settings reference guide](/v3/api-ref/settings-ref/) for more information on the available settings.

### Configure temporary settings for a process

To configure temporary settings for a process, set an environment variable with the name matching the setting you want to configure.

For example, to configure the `PREFECT_API_URL` setting to `http://127.0.0.1:4200/api` for a process, set the `PREFECT_API_URL` environment variable to `http://127.0.0.1:4200/api`.

```bash
export PREFECT_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:4200/api
```

You can use this to run a command with the temporary setting:

```bash
PREFECT_LOGGING_LEVEL=DEBUG python my_script.py
```
