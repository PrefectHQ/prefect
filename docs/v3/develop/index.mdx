These pages explain how to develop Prefect workflows. 

The **Write and run workflows** section introduces and explains Prefect's core concepts.

- [Write and run flows](/v3/develop/write-flows/) introduces the most central Prefect object, the `flow`. 
- [Write and run tasks](/v3/develop/write-tasks/) shows you how to create `task` decorated functions that represent a discrete unit of work in a Prefect workflow.
- [Run tasks in the background](/v3/develop/task-runners/) explains how to use tasks to execute small, discrete units of work quickly.
- [Log run activity](/v3/develop/logging/) shows you how to capture fine-grained information about flows and tasks for monitoring, troubleshooting, and auditing.

The **Configure runtime behavior** section introduces advanced features for interacting with running workflows and automatically taking actions based on workflow state.

- [Configure task caching](/v3/develop/task-caching/) explores how to cache task results to save money and time.
- [Write transactions](/v3/develop/transactions/) shows how to group tasks together to ensure they run atomically.
- [Pause and resume flow runs](/v3/develop/pause-resume/) explains how to halt flow runs for input.
- [Send and receive flow run inputs](/v3/develop/inputs/) highlights how to run Human-in-the-Loop workflows with Prefect.
- [Access runtime context](/v3/develop/runtime-context/) shows how to access information about the current run.

The **Manage state and configuration** section explores how to manage data and configuration in Prefect.

- [Manage results](/v3/develop/results/) explains how to store and retrieve task results.
- [Manage states](/v3/develop/manage-states/) discusses how to take action based on task and flow run states.
- [Create run artifacts](/v3/develop/artifacts/) demonstrates how to create artifacts for human consumption in the UI.
- [Set and get variables](/v3/develop/variables/) shows how to store and retrieve configuration values from API.
- [Connect to external systems](/v3/develop/blocks/) discusses how Prefect blocks can help you connect to external systems.

The **Manage concurrency** section explains how to speed up your workflows and limit activities that can take place concurrently. 

- [Run tasks concurrently or in parallel](/v3/develop/task-runners/) explains how to run tasks concurrently or in parallel with Dask or Ray.
- [Limit concurrent task runs](/v3/develop/task-run-limits/) shows how to prevent too many tasks from running simultaneously.
- [Apply concurrency and rate limits](/v3/develop/global-concurrency-limits/) demonstrates how to control concurrency and apply rate limits using Prefect's provided utilities.

Finally, [Test workflows](/v3/develop/test-workflows/) discusses tools for testing workflows.
