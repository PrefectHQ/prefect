title: Set and get variables
description: Prefect variables are dynamically-named, mutable string values.
---

Variables enable you to store and reuse non-sensitive bits of data, such as configuration information. 
They are:

- named, mutable values of any JSON type
- scoped to a self-hosted Prefect server instance or a single workspace in a Prefect Cloud account
- meant for values with infrequent writes and frequent reads (but you can create or 
modify variables at any time)
- cacheable for quicker retrieval
- most commonly loaded during flow runtime (but you can load them in other contexts to pass 
configuration information to Prefect configuration files, such as deployment steps)

<Warning>
**Variables are not Encrypted**

We do not recommend using variables to store sensitive information. Instead, use 
[Secret blocks](https://docs.prefect.io/develop/blocks/#prefect-built-in-blocks) to store and access 
sensitive information.
</Warning>

## Manage variables

Create, read, edit, and delete variables through the Prefect UI, API, and CLI. 
Names must adhere to these traditional variable naming conventions:

- Have no more than 255 characters
- Only contain lowercase alphanumeric characters ([a-z], [0-9]) or underscores (_). Spaces are not allowed.
- Be unique

Values must have less than or equal to 5000 characters.

Optionally, you can add tags to a variable.

### Through the Prefect UI

View all the variables in your self-hosted Prefect server instance or Prefect Cloud account workspace 
in the **Variables** page of the Prefect UI. Both the name and value of all variables 
are visible to anyone with access to the server or workspace.

To create a new variable:
1. Select the **+** button next to the header of the **Variables** page. 
1. Enter the name and value of the variable.

### Through the REST API

import { API } from "/snippets/resource-management/api.mdx"
import { variables } from "/snippets/resource-management/vars.mdx"

<API name="variables" href={variables.api} />

### Through the CLI

import { CLI } from "/snippets/resource-management/cli.mdx"

<CLI name="variables" href={variables.cli} />

- `prefect variable set` creates or updates a variable.
- `prefect variable get` retrieves a variable's value.
- `prefect variable unset` deletes a variable.
- `prefect variable ls` lists all variables.
- `prefect variable inspect` shows a variable's details.

### Through Terraform

import { TF } from "/snippets/resource-management/terraform.mdx"

<TF name="variables" href={variables.tf} />

## Access variables

In addition to the UI and API, you can reference variables in code and in certain Prefect configuration files.

### In Python code

You can interact with variables through the Python SDK using the `get`, `set`, and `unset` methods. 

```python
from prefect.variables import Variable

assert Variable.set("answer", 42) == Variable(name="answer", value=42, tags=[])

assert Variable.get("answer") == 42

assert Variable.set("answer", 9001, overwrite=True) == Variable(name="answer", value=9001, tags=[])

assert Variable.unset("answer") is True

assert Variable.get("answer", "fallback") == "fallback"
```

You can use `overwrite=True` to update the value of an existing variable.

<Warning>
**Contextual Behavior**

In a sync context (such as an `if __name__ == "__main__"` block or simple `def` scope), these methods are used synchronously.
In an async context (such as an `async def` scope), they are used asynchronously.
</Warning>

<CodeGroup>
```python Synchronous

from prefect import flow
from prefect.variables import Variable

@flow(log_prints=True)
def space_mission_sync(mission_name: str):
    crew = Variable.get("crew_members", default=["Backup1", "Backup2"])
    print(f"Launching {mission_name} with crew: {', '.join(crew)}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    Variable.set("crew_members", ["Zaphod", "Arthur", "Trillian"])
    space_mission_sync("Mars Expedition")
```

```python Asynchronous
import asyncio
from prefect import flow
from prefect.variables import Variable

@flow(log_prints=True)
async def space_mission_async(mission_name: str):
    crew = await Variable.get("crew_members", default=["Backup1", "Backup2"])
    print(f"Launching {mission_name} with crew: {', '.join(crew)}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    Variable.set("crew_members", ["Zaphod", "Arthur", "Trillian"])
    asyncio.run(space_mission_async("Mars Expedition"))
```
</CodeGroup>

### In `prefect.yaml` deployment steps

In `.yaml` files, variables are expressed as strings wrapped in quotes and double curly brackets: 
```
"{{ prefect.variables.my_variable }}"
```

Use variables to templatize deployment steps by 
referencing them in the `prefect.yaml` file that creates the deployments.

For example, you can pass in a variable to specify a branch for a git repo in a deployment `pull` step:

```
pull:
- prefect.deployments.steps.git_clone:
    repository: https://github.com/PrefectHQ/hello-projects.git
    branch: "{{ prefect.variables.deployment_branch }}"
```

The `deployment_branch` variable is evaluated at runtime for the deployed flow, 
allowing changes to variables used in a pull action without updating a deployment directly.
