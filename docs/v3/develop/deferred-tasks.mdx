title: Run tasks in the background
description: Learn to defer task runs to task workers running in a separate process.
---

## Introduction
Prefect [tasks](/v3/develop/write-tasks) are atomic pieces of work that you might want to cache or retry. Tasks have `.submit()` and  `.map()` methods to [simplify concurrent execution](/v3/develop/task-runners) of a task in a given workflow.

<Warning>
If you need your task results available to the calling context, you probably want to use Prefect's [task runners](/v3/develop/task-runners) via `.submit()` or `.map()` instead.
</Warning>

Sometimes your parent workflow doesn't need to resolve a task's result, it just needs the task to produce some side effect or save a result. In this case, the caller doesn't need to waste time blocking on the task's completion - instead, it can "background" that task run _somewhere else_.


Background tasks are built for this use case. They allow you to defer a task's execution to a [task worker](#task-workers) running in a separate process.

<Note>
Prefect background tasks can be used in place of tools like [Celery](https://docs.celeryq.dev/en/stable/getting-started/introduction.html) and [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/).
</Note>


### Motivating example
Background tasks are useful for dispatching heavy and/or blocking work from your application or workflow to task workers on static infrastructure that you can scale or manage independently.

For example, imagine a web application that needs to trigger an agentic `while` loop for each request, which we encapsulate as a `@task`-decorated function named `run_agent_loop`. The task will likely run longer than an acceptable request-response cycle. You can `delay()` the expensive task from your endpoint to any task workers subscribed to `run_agent_loop`'s runs.


### Define a background task
Define a task by adding the `@task` decorator to a Python function (like any other Prefect task)

```python
from prefect import task

@task(log_prints=True)
def add(a: int, b: int):
    print(f"{a} + {b} = {a + b}")
```

All task configuration options (e.g. `log_prints`, `retries`, `result_storage`) are supported.

### Background task methods
- Use the `.delay()` method to background a run of this task
- Use the `.serve()` method or `serve()` function to start a task worker and execute any waiting task runs

```python
add.delay(1, 2) # background one task run
add.delay(42, 100) # background another task run

add.serve() # start a task worker and execute any waiting task runs
```

The `.serve()` method starts a task worker subscribed to that specific task's runs.

```python
from prefect import task

@task(log_prints=True)
def add(a: int, b: int):
    print(f"{a} + {b} = {a + b}")

add.delay(1, 2) # background one task run
add.delay(42, 100) # background another task run

add.serve() # start a task worker and execute any waiting task runs
```

<Tip>
`.delay()` has the same signature as the `@task` decorated function.
</Tip>


Subscribe to many background tasks at once by providing the `serve()` utility more than one task:

```python
from prefect import task
from prefect.task_worker import serve

@task(log_prints=True)
def add(a: int, b: int):
    print(f"{a} + {b} = {a + b}")

@task(log_prints=True)
def multiply(a: int, b: int):
    print(f"{a} * {b} = {a * b}")

A = [1, 2, 3]
B = [4, 5, 6]

add.map(A, B, deferred=True) # background 3 task runs - i.e. zip(A, B)
multiply.map(A, B, deferred=True) # background 3 task runs - i.e. zip(A, B)

serve(add, multiply) # start a task worker listening for both `add` and `multiply`
```

<Tip>
`.map()` accepts `Iterable[P.args]`, `Iterable[P.kwargs]` or `unmapped` inputs as well as the `deferred: bool` argument to control whether the tasks are run in the background (instead of the current context's task runner)
</Tip>


### Task workers
Task workers are push-based consumers that subscribe to some set of tasks' runs. They can subscribe to many tasks, and be safely scaled horizontally (e.g. `replicas: 4`).

They generally do not need to be interacted with by Prefect users. Instead, they are started and stopped implicitly when you call `.serve()` or `serve()`.

## Tour of the Prefect background task examples repository

The [prefect-background-task-examples](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect-background-task-examples) repository contains reference implementations of applications leveraging background tasks.

Examples are generally Docker Compose setups that can be run locally with `docker compose up`. However, as shown above, you can decouple the task submission and execution however you like.

<summary>Expand</summary>

### Step 0: Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect-background-task-examples.git
cd prefect-background-task-examples
```

### Step 1: Setup python environment

This example uses [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), which is generally recommended for python dependency management.

```bash
uv venv
```

<CodeGroup>

```bash unix
source .venv/bin/activate
```

```bash windows
.\.venv\Scripts\activate
```

</CodeGroup>

```bash
uv pip install -U prefect
```

### Step 2: Connect to Prefect Cloud or a self-hosted Prefect server

Use either Prefect Cloud or a self-hosted Prefect server for these examples.

You must have `PREFECT_API_URL` set to a Prefect server or Prefect Cloud API URL.

<CodeGroup>

```bash oss server
prefect config set PREFECT_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:4200/api
```

```bash cloud
prefect config set PREFECT_API_URL=https://api.prefect.cloud/api/accounts/{account_id}/workspaces/{workspace_id}
```

</CodeGroup>

If using Prefect Cloud, [make sure your `PREFECT_API_URL` and `PREFECT_API_KEY` are set](https://docs.prefect.io/v3/manage/cloud/connect-to-cloud).

Otherwise, start a Prefect server by running one of the following commands:
```bash
# blocks the current terminal session
prefect server start

# run in a detached container
docker run -d -p 4200:4200 --name prefect-server prefecthq/prefect:3-latest prefect server start --host 0.0.0.0
```

### Step 3: Run the minimal local example
In `minimal-local-setup` you'll find a minimal `fastapi` application using background tasks.

```bash
cd minimal-local-setup
```

```
├── README.md
├── api.py
├── requirements.txt
├── tasks.py
└── test
```

There's a `test` script that starts an ephemeral web server and task worker, then sends a demo request and cleans up.

```bash
cat test
```

If you're comfortable, permit and run the script.
```bash
chmod +x test
./test
```

Otherwise feel free to run the commands at your own pace in separate terminals.

```bash
# start the web server
uv run --with-requirements requirements.txt uvicorn api:app --reload
```

```bash
# start the task worker
uv run --with-requirements requirements.txt tasks.py
```

<Warning>
If you're already running a Prefect server, kill it for the following steps.

For example, to kill the `prefect-server` container started in [Step 2](#step-2%3A-connect-to-prefect-cloud-or-a-self-hosted-prefect-server), run:
```bash
docker kill prefect-server
```
</Warning>

### Step 4: Run the minimal docker compose example

In `minimal-docker-compose` you'll find a minimal `fastapi` application defined in `main.py` with a `/POST /job` endpoint that calls `process_job.delay(**job_request)`.

```bash
cd minimal-docker-compose
```

```
├── README.md
├── _types.py
├── compose.yaml
├── main.py
├── pyproject.toml
└── tasks.py
```

Start the Docker Compose stack in detached mode:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```


Navigate to [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs) and try out the `/POST /job` endpoint.

Watch the logs:

```bash
docker compose logs -f
```
