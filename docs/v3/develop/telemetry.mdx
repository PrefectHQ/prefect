Prefect collects anonymous usage telemetry to help improve the product. This page explains what data is collected, how it's used, and how to opt out.

## What We Collect

Prefect SDK telemetry tracks anonymous usage patterns to understand how developers use the product. We collect:

| Data | Example | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| Events | `sdk_imported`, `first_flow_run` | Track feature adoption |
| Prefect version | `3.2.0` | Version distribution |
| Python version | `3.12.1` | Compatibility planning |
| Platform | `Darwin`, `Linux`, `Windows` | Platform support |
| Architecture | `arm64`, `x86_64` | Build optimization |
| Anonymous device ID | `uuid4()` | Session correlation (not user-identifiable) |

### Events Tracked

The SDK tracks milestone events in the "Quick Start Funnel":

- `sdk_imported` - When Prefect is first imported
- `first_flow_defined` - When you define your first flow
- `first_flow_run` - When you successfully run your first flow
- `first_deployment_created` - When you create your first deployment
- `first_schedule_created` - When you create your first scheduled deployment

Each milestone event is only sent once per installation.

## What We Do NOT Collect

We respect your privacy. Prefect telemetry **never** collects:

- User identity, credentials, or API keys
- Code, flow definitions, or task parameters
- Flow names, task names, or deployment names
- File paths or directory structures
- Environment variables or secrets
- Error messages or stack traces
- IP addresses or network information
- Any personally identifiable information (PII)

## How to Opt Out

You can disable telemetry using any of these methods:

### Environment Variable

```bash
# Prefect-specific setting
export PREFECT_SERVER_ANALYTICS_ENABLED=false

# Industry standard DO_NOT_TRACK
export DO_NOT_TRACK=1
```

### Prefect CLI

```bash
prefect config set PREFECT_SERVER_ANALYTICS_ENABLED=false
```

### Automatic CI Detection

Telemetry is automatically disabled when Prefect detects a CI environment. We check for common CI environment variables including:

- `CI`
- `GITHUB_ACTIONS`
- `GITLAB_CI`
- `JENKINS_URL`
- `TRAVIS`
- `CIRCLECI`
- `BUILDKITE`
- `TF_BUILD` (Azure DevOps)
- `CODEBUILD_BUILD_ID` (AWS CodeBuild)
- `BITBUCKET_COMMIT`

## First-Run Notice

The first time you import Prefect with telemetry enabled in an interactive terminal, you'll see a brief notice:

```
Prefect collects anonymous usage data to improve the product.
To opt out: PREFECT_SERVER_ANALYTICS_ENABLED=false or DO_NOT_TRACK=1
Learn more: https://docs.prefect.io/develop/telemetry
```

This notice only appears once and only in interactive terminal sessions (not in scripts, CI, or non-TTY environments).

## Data Storage

Telemetry data is stored locally in your Prefect home directory:

```
~/.prefect/.sdk_telemetry/
├── device_id      # Anonymous UUID for this installation
├── milestones.json # Tracks which milestone events have been sent
└── notice_shown    # Marker that the first-run notice was displayed
```

## Existing User Detection

Onboarding events (`sdk_imported`, `first_flow_defined`, etc.) are only emitted for new Prefect users. If you already have Prefect artifacts in your `~/.prefect` directory (such as `profiles.toml`, `.prefect.db`, or `storage/`), you are considered an existing user and these onboarding events will not be emitted.

This ensures that users upgrading to a version with telemetry don't trigger onboarding events that are meant to track new user adoption.
