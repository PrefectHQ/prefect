title: Using prefect client methods
description: Learn how to use the `PrefectClient` to interact with the API.
---

## Overview


The [`PrefectClient`](https://prefect-python-sdk-docs.netlify.app/prefect/client/) 
offers methods to simplify common operations against Prefect's REST API that may not be abstracted away by the SDK.

For example, to [reschedule flow runs](/v3/develop/interact-with-api/#reschedule-late-flow-runs), one might use methods like:
  - `read_flow_runs` with a `FlowRunFilter` to read certain flow runs
  - `create_flow_run_from_deployment` to schedule new flow runs
  - `delete_flow_run` to delete a very `Late` flow run



### Getting a client

By default, `get_client()` returns an asynchronous client to be used as a context manager, but you may also use a synchronous client.

<CodeGroup>

```python async
from prefect import get_client

async with get_client() as client:
    response = await client.hello()
    print(response.json()) # ðŸ‘‹
```

You can also use a synchronous client:

```python sync
from prefect import get_client

with get_client(sync_client=True) as client:
    response = client.hello()
    print(response.json()) # ðŸ‘‹
```

</CodeGroup>

## Examples

These examples are meant to illustrate how one might develop their own utilities for interacting with the API.

<Note>
If you believe a client method is missing, or you'd like to see a specific pattern better represented in the SDK generally, please [open an issue](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect/issues/new/choose).

### Reschedule late flow runs

To bulk reschedule flow runs that are late, delete the late flow runs and create new ones in a 
`Scheduled` state with a delay. This is useful if you accidentally scheduled many 
flow runs of a deployment to an inactive work pool, for example.

The following example reschedules the last three late flow runs of a deployment named 
`healthcheck-storage-test` to run six hours later than their original expected start time. 
It also deletes any remaining late flow runs of that deployment.

First, define the rescheduling function:

```python
async def reschedule_late_flow_runs(
    deployment_name: str,
    delay: timedelta,
    most_recent_n: int,
    delete_remaining: bool = True,
    states: list[str] | None = None
) -> list[FlowRun]:
    states = states or ["Late"]

    async with get_client() as client:
        flow_runs = await client.read_flow_runs(
            flow_run_filter=FlowRunFilter(
                state=dict(name=dict(any_=states)),
                expected_start_time=dict(before_=datetime.now(timezone.utc)),
            ),
            deployment_filter=DeploymentFilter(name={'like_': deployment_name}),
            sort=FlowRunSort.START_TIME_DESC,
            limit=most_recent_n if not delete_remaining else None
        )

        rescheduled_flow_runs: list[FlowRun] = []
        for i, run in enumerate(flow_runs):
            await client.delete_flow_run(flow_run_id=run.id)
            if i < most_recent_n:
                new_run = await client.create_flow_run_from_deployment(
                    deployment_id=run.deployment_id,
                    state=Scheduled(scheduled_time=run.expected_start_time + delay),
                )
                rescheduled_flow_runs.append(new_run)
            
        return rescheduled_flow_runs
```

Then use it to reschedule flows:

```python
rescheduled_flow_runs = asyncio.run(
    reschedule_late_flow_runs(
        deployment_name="healthcheck-storage-test",
        delay=timedelta(hours=6),
        most_recent_n=3,
    )
)
```

```python reschedule_late_flows.py
from __future__ import annotations

import asyncio
from datetime import datetime, timedelta, timezone

from prefect import get_client
from prefect.client.schemas.filters import DeploymentFilter, FlowRunFilter
from prefect.client.schemas.objects import FlowRun
from prefect.client.schemas.sorting import FlowRunSort
from prefect.states import Scheduled

async def reschedule_late_flow_runs(
    deployment_name: str,
    delay: timedelta,
    most_recent_n: int,
    delete_remaining: bool = True,
    states: list[str] | None = None
) -> list[FlowRun]:
    states = states or ["Late"]

    async with get_client() as client:

            flow_run_filter=FlowRunFilter(

            sort=FlowRunSort.START_TIME_DESC,
            limit=most_recent_n if not delete_remaining else None
        )

        if not flow_runs:
            print(f"No flow runs found in states: {states!r}")
            return []
        
        rescheduled_flow_runs: list[FlowRun] = []
        for i, run in enumerate(flow_runs):
            await client.delete_flow_run(flow_run_id=run.id)
            if i < most_recent_n:
                new_run = await client.create_flow_run_from_deployment(

                    state=Scheduled(scheduled_time=run.expected_start_time + delay),

### Get the last `N` completed flow runs from your workspace

To get the last `N` completed flow runs from your workspace, use `read_flow_runs` and `prefect.client.schemas`.

This example gets the last three completed flow runs from your workspace:

```python
async def get_most_recent_flow_runs(
    n: int,
    states: list[str] | None = None
) -> list[FlowRun]:    
    async with get_client() as client:
        return await client.read_flow_runs(
            flow_run_filter=FlowRunFilter(
                state={'type': {'any_': states or ["COMPLETED"]}}
            ),
            sort=FlowRunSort.END_TIME_DESC,
            limit=n,
        )
```

Use it to get the last 3 completed runs:

```python
flow_runs: list[FlowRun] = asyncio.run(
    get_most_recent_flow_runs(n=3)
)
```

<Accordion title="View the complete example">

```python get_recent_flows.py
from __future__ import annotations

import asyncio

from prefect import get_client
from prefect.client.schemas.filters import FlowRunFilter
from prefect.client.schemas.objects import FlowRun
from prefect.client.schemas.sorting import FlowRunSort

async def get_most_recent_flow_runs(
    n: int,
    states: list[str] | None = None
) -> list[FlowRun]:    
    async with get_client() as client:
        return await client.read_flow_runs(
            flow_run_filter=FlowRunFilter(
                state={'type': {'any_': states or ["COMPLETED"]}}
            ),
            sort=FlowRunSort.END_TIME_DESC,
            limit=n,
        )


if __name__ == "__main__":
    flow_runs: list[FlowRun] = asyncio.run(
        get_most_recent_flow_runs(n=3)
    )
    assert len(flow_runs) == 3
    
    assert all(
        run.state.is_completed() for run in flow_runs
    )
    assert (
        end_times := [run.end_time for run in flow_runs]
    ) == sorted(end_times, reverse=True)
```

Instead of the last three from the whole workspace, you can also use the `DeploymentFilter` 
to get the last three completed flow runs of a specific deployment.

### Transition all running flows to cancelled through the Client

Use `get_client`to set multiple runs to a `Cancelled` state.
This example cancels all flow runs that are in `Pending`, `Running`, `Scheduled`, or `Late` states when the script is run.

```python
async def list_flow_runs_with_states(states: list[str]) -> list[FlowRun]:
    async with get_client() as client:
        return await client.read_flow_runs(
            flow_run_filter=FlowRunFilter(
                state=FlowRunFilterState(
                    name=FlowRunFilterStateName(any_=states)
                )
            )
        )

async def cancel_flow_runs(flow_runs: list[FlowRun]):
    async with get_client() as client:
        for flow_run in flow_runs:
            state = flow_run.state.copy(
                update={"name": "Cancelled", "type": StateType.CANCELLED}
            )
            await client.set_flow_run_state(flow_run.id, state, force=True)
```

Cancel all pending, running, scheduled or late flows:

```python
async def bulk_cancel_flow_runs():
    states = ["Pending", "Running", "Scheduled", "Late"]
    flow_runs = await list_flow_runs_with_states(states)

    while flow_runs:
        print(f"Cancelling {len(flow_runs)} flow runs")
        await cancel_flow_runs(flow_runs)
        flow_runs = await list_flow_runs_with_states(states)

asyncio.run(bulk_cancel_flow_runs())
```

            state_updates: dict[str, str] = {}
            state_updates.setdefault("name", "Cancelled")
            state_updates.setdefault("type", StateType.CANCELLED)
            state = flow_run.state.copy(update=state_updates)
            await client.set_flow_run_state(flow_run.id, state, force=True)

        print(f"Cancelling {len(flow_runs)} flow runs\n")
        await cancel_flow_runs(flow_runs)
        flow_runs = await list_flow_runs_with_states(states)
