In the [Deployments](/2.12.1/tutorial/deployments/) tutorial, we looked at serving a flow that enables scheduling or creating flow runs via the Prefect API.

With our Python script in hand, we can build a Docker image for our script, allowing us to serve our flow in various remote environments. We'll use Kubernetes in this guide, but you can use any Docker-compatible infrastructure.

In this guide we'll:

- Write a Dockerfile to build an image that stores our Prefect flow code.
- Build a Docker image for our flow.
- Deploy and run our Docker image on a Kubernetes cluster.

## Prerequisites

To complete this guide, you'll need the following:

- A Python script that defines and serves a flow. 
  - We'll use the flow script and deployment from the [Deployments](/2.12.1/tutorial/deployments/) tutorial. 
- Access to a running Prefect API server.
  - You can sign up for a forever free [Prefect Cloud account](https://docs.prefect.io/cloud/) or run a Prefect API server locally with `prefect server start`.
- [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/) installed on your machine.

## Writing a Dockerfile

First let's make a clean directory to work from, `prefect-docker-guide`.

<div class="terminal">
```bash
mkdir prefect-docker-guide
cd prefect-docker-guide
```
</div>

In this directory, we'll create a sub-directory named `flows` and put our flow script from the [Deployments](/2.12.1/tutorial/deployments/) tutorial in it.

<div class="terminal">
```bash
mkdir flows
cd flows
touch prefect-docker-guide-flow.py
```
</div>

Here's the flow code for reference:

```python title="prefect-docker-guide-flow.py"
import httpx
from prefect import flow


@flow(log_prints=True)
def get_repo_info(repo_name: str = "PrefectHQ/prefect"):
    url = f"https://api.github.com/repos/{repo_name}"
    response = httpx.get(url)
    response.raise_for_status()
    repo = response.json()
    print(f"{repo_name} repository statistics 🤓:")
    print(f"Stars 🌠 : {repo['stargazers_count']}")
    print(f"Forks 🍴 : {repo['forks_count']}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    get_repo_info.serve(name="prefect-docker-guide")
```

The next file we'll add to the `prefect-docker-guide` directory is a `requirements.txt`. We'll include all dependencies required for our `prefect-docker-guide-flow.py` script in the Docker image we'll build.

<div class="terminal">
```bash
touch requirements.txt
```
</div>

Here's what we'll put in our `requirements.txt` file:

```txt title="requirements.txt"
prefect>=2.12.0
httpx
```

Next, we'll create a `Dockerfile` that we'll use to create a Docker image that will also store the flow code. 

<div class="terminal">
```bash
touch Dockerfile
```
</div>

We'll add the following content to our `Dockerfile`:

```dockerfile title="Dockerfile"
# We're using the latest version of Prefect with Python 3.10
FROM prefecthq/prefect:2-python3.10

# Add our requirements.txt file to the image and install dependencies
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt --trusted-host pypi.python.org --no-cache-dir

# Add our flow code to the image
COPY flows /opt/prefect/flows

# Run our flow script when the container starts
CMD ["python", "flows/prefect-docker-guide-flow.py"]
```

## Building a Docker image

Now that we have a Dockerfile we can build our image by running: 

<div class="terminal">
```bash
docker build -t prefect-docker-guide-image .
```
</div>

We can check that our build worked by running a container from our new image.

=== "Cloud"

    Our container will need an API URL and and API key to communicate with Prefect Cloud. 
    
    - You can get an API key from the [API Keys](https://docs.prefect.io/2.12.0/cloud/users/api-keys/) section of the user settings in the Prefect UI. 

    - You can get your API URL by running `prefect config view` and copying the `PREFECT_API_URL` value.

    We'll provide both these values to our container by passing them as environment variables with the `-e` flag.

    <div class="terminal">
    ```bash
    docker run -e PREFECT_API_URL=YOUR_PREFECT_API_URL -e PREFECT_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY prefect-docker-guide-image
    ```
    </div>

    After running the above command, the container should start up and serve the flow within the container!

=== "Self-hosted"

    Our container will need an API URL and network access to communicate with the Prefect API. 
    
    For this guide, we'll assume the Prefect API is running on the same machine that we'll run our container on and the Prefect API was started with `prefect server start`. If you're running a different setup, check out the [Hosting a Prefect server guide](/2.12.1/guides/host/) for information on how to connect to your Prefect API instance.
    
    To ensure that our flow container can communicate with the Prefect API, we'll set our `PREFECT_API_URL` to `http://host.docker.internal:4200/api`. If you're running Linux, you'll need to set your `PREFECT_API_URL` to `http://localhost:4200/api` and use the `--network="host"` option instead.

    <div class="terminal">
```bash
    docker run --network="host" -e PREFECT_API_URL=http://host.docker.internal:4200/api prefect-docker-guide-image
```
</div>

    After running the above command, the container should start up and serve the flow within the container!

## Deploying to a remote environment

Now that we have a Docker image with our flow code embedded, we can deploy it to a remote environment! 

For this guide, we'll simulate a remote environment by using Kubernetes locally with Docker Desktop. You can use the [instructions provided by Docker to set up Kubernetes locally.](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/kubernetes/) 

### Creating a Kubernetes deployment manifest

To ensure the process serving our flow is always running, we'll create a [Kubernetes deployment](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/). If our flow's container ever crashes, Kubernetes will automatically restart it, ensuring that we won't miss any scheduled runs.

First, we'll create a `deployment-manifest.yaml` file in our `prefect-docker-guide` directory:

<div class="terminal">
```bash
touch deployment-manifest.yaml
```
</div>

And we'll add the following content to our `deployment-manifest.yaml` file:

=== "Cloud"
```yaml title="deployment-manifest.yaml"
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    metadata:
      name: prefect-docker-guide
    spec:
      replicas: 1
      selector:
        matchLabels:
          flow: get-repo-info
      template:
        metadata:
          labels:
            flow: get-repo-info
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: flow-container
            image: prefect-docker-guide-image:latest
            env:
            - name: PREFECT_API_URL
              value: YOUR_PREFECT_API_URL
            - name: PREFECT_API_KEY
              value: YOUR_API_KEY
            # Never pull the image because we're using a local image
            imagePullPolicy: Never
```

    !!!tip "Keep your API key secret"
          In the above manifest we are passing in the Prefect API URL and API key as environment variables. This approach is simple, but it is not secure. If you are deploying your flow to a remote cluster, you should use a [Kubernetes secret](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/) to store your API key.


=== "Self-hosted"
```yaml title="deployment-manifest.yaml"
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    metadata:
      name: prefect-docker-guide
    spec:
      replicas: 1
      selector:
        matchLabels:
          flow: get-repo-info
      template:
        metadata:
          labels:
            flow: get-repo-info
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: flow-container
            image: prefect-docker-guide-image:latest
            env:
            - name: PREFECT_API_URL
              value: http://host.docker.internal:4200/api
            # Never pull the image because we're using a local image
            imagePullPolicy: Never
```

    !!!tip "Linux users"
        If you're running Linux, you'll need to set your `PREFECT_API_URL` to use the IP address of your machine instead of `host.docker.internal`.

This manifest defines how our image will run when deployed in our Kubernetes cluster. Note that we will be running a single replica of our flow container. If you want to run multiple replicas of your flow container to keep up with an active schedule, or because our flow is resource-intensive, you can increase the `replicas` value.

### Deploying our flow to the cluster

Now that we have a deployment manifest, we can deploy our flow to the cluster by running:

<div class="terminal">
```bash
kubectl apply -f deployment-manifest.yaml
```
</div>

We can monitor the status of our Kubernetes deployment by running:

<div class="terminal">
```bash
kubectl get deployments
```
</div>

Once the deployment has successfully started, we can check the logs of our flow container by running the following:

<div class="terminal">
```bash
kubectl logs -l flow=get-repo-info
```
</div>

Now that we're serving our flow in our cluster, we can trigger a flow run by running:

<div class="terminal">
```bash
prefect deployment run get-repo-info/prefect-docker-guide
```
</div>

If we navigate to the URL provided by the `prefect deployment run` command, we can follow the flow run via the logs in the Prefect UI!

## Next Steps

We only served a single flow in this guide, but you can extend this setup to serve multiple flows in a single Docker image by updating your Python script to using `flow.to_deployment` and `serve` to [serve multiple flows or the same flow with different configuration](/2.12.1/concepts/flows#serving-multiple-flows-at-once).
