# Next Steps

In this tutorial we showed how Prefect can be used to improve the behavior of your workflow. However, there is a lot more to Prefect that we didn't cover!

## Logging within your Tasks

Within our tutorial `Tasks` are displaying information via Python's built in `print()` function:

```python
@task
def load_reference_data(ref_data):
    print("saving reference data...")

    db = aclib.Database()
    db.update_reference_data(ref_data)
```

However, there is already a `Logger` object made available to you within `Tasks`:

```python{3,4}
@task
def load_reference_data(ref_data):
    logger = prefect.context.get("logger")
    logger.info("saving reference data...")

    db = aclib.Database()
    db.update_reference_data(ref_data)
```

## Storing Task Results

In this particular Aircraft ETL example we did not have an explicit need to keep intermediate results at each step along the way. However, Prefect provides a `Result` abstraction that enables users to persist `Results` returned from each `Task` to a storage of choice:

```python{1,3}
from prefect.engine.results import LocalResult

result = LocalResult(dir="./my-results")

with Flow("Aircraft-ETL", result=result) as flow:
    ...

flow.run()
```

Now any results generated by individual `Tasks` are written out to the `./my-results` directory, relative to where the Flow was executed from. Prefect provides many [supported Results](/api/latest/engine/results.html) to persist results to common storage options such as S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Storage, and more.

## Advanced Control Structures

In this tutorial we could have gone one step further and asked for fetching all aircraft data within X radius of multiple Y airports. In this case `Mapping` would be the easiest way to tackle this, calling our `extract_live_data` Task for each desired airport.

## Ready-made Task Library

Within our tutorial `Tasks` were always user-provided functions, however, Prefect provides a [library of ready-made `Tasks`](/core/task_library/overview.html). Here's an example `Flow` that uses `ShellTasks` to run arbitrary commands:

```python{2,4,7-9}
from prefect import Flow
from prefect.tasks.shell import ShellTask
 
shell = ShellTask()
with Flow("Simple Pipeline") as flow:
   flow.chain(
       shell(command='pip install -r requirements.txt'),
       shell(command='black --check .'),
       shell(command='pytest .'),
   )
 
flow.run()
```

The Task library includes integrations with Kubernetes, GitHub, Slack, Docker, AWS, GCP, [and more](/core/task_library/overview.html)!
