# Next Steps

In this tutorial we showed how Prefect could be used to improve the behavior of your workflow. However, there is a lot more to Prefect that we didn't cover!

## Logging within your Tasks

Within our tutorial `Tasks` have been displaying information via Python's built in `print()` function:

```python
@task
def load_reference_data(ref_data):
    print("saving reference data...")

    db = aclib.Database()
    db.update_reference_data(ref_data)
```

However, there is already a `Logger` object made available to you within `Tasks`:

```python{3,4}
@task
def load_reference_data(ref_data):
    logger = prefect.context.get("logger")
    logger.info("saving reference data...")

    db = aclib.Database()
    db.update_reference_data(ref_data)
```

## Advanced Control Structures

In this tutorial we could have gone one step further and asked for fetching all aircraft data within X radius of multiple Y airports. In this case `Mapping` would be the easiest way to tackle this, calling our `extract_live_data` Task for each desired airport.

## Rich Handlers for Storing Task Results

This particular ETL example we stepped through in this tutorial did not have an explicit need to keep intermediate results at each step along the way. However, Prefect provides a `ResultHandler` abstraction to enable users to persist `Results` returned from each `Task` to a storage of choice:

```python{1}
result_handler = LocalResultHandler(dir="./my-results")

with Flow("Aircraft-ETL", result_handler=result_handler) as flow:
    ...

flow.run()
```

Now any results generated by individual `Tasks` are written out to a `./my-results` directory relative to where the Flow was executed from. Prefect provides a [supported Result Handlers](/api/latest/engine/result_handlers.html) to persist results to common storege options such as S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Storage, and more.

## Ready-made Task Library

Within our tutorial `Tasks` were always user-provided functions, however, Prefect provides a [library of ready-made `Tasks`](/core/task_library/). Here's an example `Flow` that uses `ShellTasks` to run arbitrary commands:

```python{2,4,7-9}
from prefect import Flow
from prefect.tasks.shell import ShellTask
 
shell = ShellTask()
with Flow("Simple Pipeline") as flow:
   flow.chain(
       shell(command='pip install -r requirements.txt'),
       shell(command='black --check .'),
       shell(command='pytest .'),
   )
 
flow.run()
```

The Task library includes integrations with Kubernetes, GitHub, Slack, Docker, AWS, GCP, [and more](/core/task_library/)!
