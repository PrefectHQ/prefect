# Overview

This is a Quick Start guide to help you get a basic Prefect flow up and running on your local machine.  If you want to run a simple flow and have no need (yet) for an API or UI, then Prefect Core is for you.  If you know that you want a UI or API, then check out our [orchestration layer](/orchestration/getting-started/quick-start/) docs.  

Once you've gone through the tutorial, we encourage you to find out more about Prefect core concepts by reading [Thinking Prefectly](/core/about_prefect/thinking-prefectly/) or to check out our list of [more resources](/core/getting_started/more-resources/).
