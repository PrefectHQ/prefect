# Overview

This is a Quick Start guide to help you get a basic Prefect 1 flow up and running on your local machine.  If you want to run a simple flow and have no need (yet) for an API or UI, then Prefect Core is for you.  If you know that you want a UI or API, then check out our [orchestration layer](/orchestration/getting-started/quick-start.md) docs.  

Once you've gone through the tutorial, we encourage you to find out more about Prefect core concepts by reading [Thinking Prefectly](/core/about_prefect/thinking-prefectly.md) or to check out our list of [more resources](/core/getting_started/more-resources.md).

::: tip Prefect 2
With general availability of Prefect 2, we recommend new users start with [Prefect 2](https://docs.prefect.io/#getting-started-with-prefect).

If you are unsure which Prefect version to choose for your specific use case, [this Prefect Discourse page](https://discourse.prefect.io/t/should-i-start-with-prefect-2-0-orion-skipping-prefect-1-0/544) may help you decide.
