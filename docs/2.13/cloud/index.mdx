## User accounts

When you sign up for Prefect Cloud, a personal account is automatically provisioned for you.
A personal account gives you access to profile settings where you can view and administer your:

- Profile, including profile handle and image
- API keys

As a personal account owner, you can create a [workspace](#workspaces) and invite collaborators to your workspace.

[Organizations](#organizations) in Prefect Cloud enable you to invite users to collaborate in your workspaces with the ability to set [role-based access controls (RBAC)](#roles-and-custom-permissions) for organization members.
Organizations may also configure [service accounts](#service-accounts) with API keys for non-user access to the Prefect Cloud API.

!!! cloud-ad "Prefect Cloud plans for teams of every size"
    See the [Prefect Cloud plans](https://www.prefect.io/pricing/) for details on options for individual users and teams.

## Workspaces

A workspace is an isolated environment within Prefect Cloud for your flows, deployments, and block configuration.
See the [Workspaces](/2.13/cloud/workspaces/) documentation for more information about configuring and using workspaces.

Each workspace keeps track of its own:

- [Flow runs](/2.13/concepts/flows/) and task runs executed in an environment that is [syncing with the workspace](/2.13/cloud/#workspaces)
- [Flows](/2.13/concepts/flows/) associated with flow runs and deployments observed by the Prefect Cloud API
- [Deployments](/2.13/concepts/deployments/)
- [Work pools](/2.13/concepts/work-pools/)
- [Blocks](/2.13/concepts/blocks/) and [storage](/2.13/concepts/storage/)
- [Automations](/2.13/cloud/automations/)

## Events

Prefect Cloud allows you to see your [events](/2.13/cloud/events/).
![Prefect UI](/2.13/img/ui/event-feed.png)

## Automations

Prefect Cloud [automations](/2.13/cloud/automations/) provide additional notification capabilities as the open-source Prefect server.
Automations enable you to configure triggers and actions that can kick off flow runs, pause deployments, or send custom notifications in response to real-time monitoring events.

## Error summaries

Prefect Cloud error summaries, enabled by Marvin AI, distill the error logs of `Failed` and `Crashed` flow runs into actionable information.
To enable this feature and others powered by Marvin AI, visit the settings page for your account.

## Organizations <span class="badge orgs"></span>

A Prefect Cloud [organization](/2.13/cloud/organizations/) account type enables more fine-grained control over workspace collaboration.
With an organization account you can:

- Invite members to join the organization.
- Create organization workspaces.
- Configure members roles and permissions within the organization and for individual workspaces.
- Create service accounts with credentials for non-user API access.

See the [Organizations](/2.13/cloud/organizations/) documentation for more information about managing users, service accounts, and workspaces in a Prefect Cloud organization.

## Service accounts <span class="badge orgs"></span>

Service accounts enable you to create a Prefect Cloud API key that is not associated with a user account.
Service accounts are typically used to configure API access for running workers or executing flow runs on remote infrastructure.

See the [service accounts](/2.13/cloud/users/service-accounts/) documentation for more information about creating and managing service accounts in a Prefect Cloud organization.

## Roles and custom permissions <span class="badge orgs"></span>

Role-based access control (RBAC) functionality in Prefect Cloud enables you to assign users granular permissions to perform certain activities within an organization or a workspace.

See the [role-based access controls (RBAC)](../cloud/users/roles/) documentation for more information about managing user roles in a Prefect Cloud organization.

## Single Sign-on (SSO) <span class="badge orgs"></span> <span class="badge enterprise"></span>

Prefect Cloud's [Organization and Enterprise plans](https://www.prefect.io/pricing) offer [single sign-on (SSO)](/2.13/cloud/users/sso/) authentication integration with your team’s identity provider. SSO integration can bet set up with identity providers that support OIDC and SAML.
SCIM provisioning is also available with Enterprise plans.

## Audit log <span class="badge orgs"></span> <span class="badge enterprise"></span>

Prefect Cloud's [Organization and Enterprise plans](https://www.prefect.io/pricing) offer [Audit Log](/2.13/cloud/users/audit-log/) compliance and transparency tools.
Audit logs provide a chronological record of activities performed by users in your organization, allowing you to monitor detailed actions for security and compliance purposes.

## Prefect Cloud REST API

The [Prefect REST API](/2.13/api-ref/rest-api/) is used for communicating data from Prefect clients to Prefect Cloud or a local Prefect server so that orchestration can be performed.
This API is mainly consumed by Prefect clients like the Prefect Python Client or the Prefect UI.

!!! note "Prefect Cloud REST API interactive documentation"
    Prefect Cloud REST API documentation is available at <a href="https://app.prefect.cloud/api/docs" target="_blank">https://app.prefect.cloud/api/docs</a>.

## Start using Prefect Cloud
