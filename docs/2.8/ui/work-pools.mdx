[Work Pools](/2.8/concepts/work-pools/) and agents work together to bridge your orchestration environment &mdash; a local Prefect server or Prefect Cloud &mdash; and your execution environments. Work pools gather flow runs for scheduled deployments, and agents pick up work from their configured work pool queues.

Work pool configuration lets you specify which queues handle which flow runs. You can filter runs based on tags and specific deployments.

You can create, edit, manage, and delete work pools through the Prefect API server, Prefect Cloud UI, or [Prefect CLI commands](/2.8/concepts/work-pools/#work-pool-configuration).

## Managing work queues

To manage work pools in the UI, click the **Work Pools** icon. This displays a list of currently configured work pools.

See the [Agents & Work Pools](/2.8/concepts/work-pools/) documentation for details on configuring agents and work pools, including creating work pools from the Prefect CLI.
