All contributions to Prefect need to start on [a fork of the repository](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo).
Once you have successfully forked [the Prefect repo](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect), clone a local version to your machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GITHUB-USERNAME/prefect.git
cd prefect
```

Create a branch with an informative name:
```
git checkout -b fix-for-issue-NUM
```
After committing your changes to this branch, you can then open a pull request from your fork that we will review with you.
