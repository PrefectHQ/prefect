# Welcome!

[Prefect Cloud](https://www.prefect.io/products/cloud) is a complete negative engineering solution. Start by building a workflow in the open-source [Prefect Core](https://www.prefect.io/products/core) engine and then instantly supercharge it by deploying it to our managed orchestration platform.

Cloud is powered by Prefect's innovative [Hybrid Execution Engine](https://www.prefect.io/why-prefect/hybrid-model), which means that your code and data **always remain private** on your infrastructure. You can take full advantage of Prefect Cloud's UI, API, scheduler, secrets management, team management, and more without ever worrying about your most valuable information leaving your control.

We built Prefect Cloud to support all workflows, from globally-distributed multi-cloud coordination to blinking lights on a Raspberry Pi. What will you build?

Happy engineering!

_- The Prefect Team_
