# Users <span class="badge cloud"></span>

*Users* in Prefect Cloud are profiles for individuals created by signing up at [app.prefect.cloud](https://app.prefect.cloud). Each user has their own personal account, and they can also be added as a Member of other [Organizations](/cloud/organizations/) and [Workspaces](/cloud/workspaces/).

Users can be granted [roles](/cloud/users/roles/) with their respective permission sets at the *Account* and *Workspace* levels. 

Users can also create [API keys](/cloud/users/api-keys/) for connecting Prefect Cloud to their local development environment.
