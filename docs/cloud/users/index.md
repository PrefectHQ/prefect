# Users <span class="badge cloud"></span>

*Users* in Prefect Cloud are profiles for individuals created by signing up at [app.prefect.cloud](https://app.prefect.cloud). Each user has their own personal account, and they can also be added as a Member of other [Organizations](/cloud/organizations/) and [Workspaces](/cloud/workspaces/).

## User Settings
Users can access their settings in the [profile menu](https://app.prefect.cloud/my/profile), including:

- Profile: Viewing and editing basic information like account handle.
- API keys: Creating [API keys](/cloud/users/api-keys/) for connecting Prefect Cloud to their local development environment.
- Billing: Entering payment information, for adding additional collaborators, workspaces, or creating an [Organization](/cloud/organizations/).
- Preferences: Managing color mode and time zone information.

## Roles

Users can be granted [roles](/cloud/users/roles/) with their respective permission sets at the *Account* and *Workspace* levels.
