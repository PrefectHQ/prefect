# Next Steps

So far we've run a Flow locally a variety of ways and moved up to distributing the Flow execution with Kubernetes and Prefect Cloud. This is just the beginning because the Prefect API has many more features to explore!

## Concepts

Visit the [Concept](/cloud/concepts/api.html) docs for actions such as working directly with Prefect's [GraphQL API](/cloud/concepts/graphql.html), diving into the [CLI](/cloud/concepts/cli.html), setting [concurrency limits](/cloud/concepts/concurrency-limiting.html) on your Cloud runs, and more.

## Agents

To learn more about Prefect Agents, [Flow affinity](/cloud/agents/overview.html#flow-affinity-labels) via labels, or find information on platform specific Agents visit the [Agent](/cloud/agents/overview.html) documentation.

## Storage Options

Store your Flows in the cloud using Azure, GCS, or S3! For more information visit the [Storage Options](/cloud/execution/storage_options.html) documentation.

## Execution Environments

For information related to Execution Environments take a look at the [Execution](/cloud/execution/overview.html) documentation.

## Deployment Recipes

Check out some of the [Deployment Recipes](/cloud/recipes/configuring_storage.html) that are written below for some helpful Flow deployment patterns.
