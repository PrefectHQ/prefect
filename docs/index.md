### Prefect

We've rebuilt data engineering for the data science era.

Prefect is a new workflow management system, designed for modern infrastructure and powered by the open-source Prefect Core workflow engine. Users organize `Tasks` into `Flows`, and Prefect takes care of the rest.

Read the [docs](/core/); get the [code](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect); ask us [anything](https://www.prefect.io/slack); chat with the community via [Prefect Discourse](https://discourse.prefect.io/)!

### Hello, world! ðŸ‘‹

```python
from prefect import task, Flow, Parameter


@task(log_stdout=True)
def say_hello(name):
    print("Hello, {}!".format(name))


with Flow("My First Flow") as flow:
    name = Parameter('name')
    say_hello(name)


flow.run(name='world') # "Hello, world!"
flow.run(name='Marvin') # "Hello, Marvin!"
```
