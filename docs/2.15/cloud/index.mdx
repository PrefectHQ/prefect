Prefect Cloud is a hosted workflow application framework that provides all the capabilities of Prefect server plus additional features, such as:

- automations, events, and webhooks so you can create event-driven workflows
- workspaces, RBAC, SSO, audit logs and related user management tools for collaboration
- push work pools for running flows on serverless infrastructure without a worker
- error summaries powered by Marvin AI to help you resolve errors faster

!!! success "Getting Started with Prefect Cloud"
    Ready to jump right in and start running with Prefect Cloud? See the [Quickstart](/2.15/getting-started/quickstart/) and follow the instructions on the **Cloud** tabs to write and deploy your first Prefect Cloud-monitored flow run.

Prefect Cloud includes all the features in the open-source Prefect server plus the following:

!!! cloud-ad "Prefect Cloud features"
    - [User accounts](#user-accounts) &mdash; personal accounts for working in Prefect Cloud.
    - [Workspaces](/2.15/cloud/workspaces/) &mdash; isolated environments to organize your flows, deployments, and flow runs.
    - [Automations](/2.15/cloud/automations/) &mdash; configure triggers, actions, and notifications in response to real-time monitoring events.
    - [Email notifications](/2.15/cloud/automations/) &mdash; send email alerts from Prefect's server based on automation triggers.
    - [Service accounts](/2.15/cloud/users/service-accounts/) &mdash; configure API access for running workers or executing flow runs on remote infrastructure.
    - [Custom role-based access controls (RBAC)](/2.15/cloud/users/roles/) &mdash; assign users granular permissions to perform certain activities within an account or a workspace.
    - [Single Sign-on (SSO)](/2.15/cloud/users/sso/) &mdash; authentication using your identity provider.
    - [Audit Log](/2.15/cloud/users/audit-log/) &mdash; a record of user activities to monitor security and compliance.
    - Collaboration &mdash; invite other people to your account.
    - Error summaries  &mdash; (enabled by Marvin AI) distill the error logs of `Failed` and `Crashed` flow runs into actionable information.
    - [Push work pools](/2.15/guides/deployment/push-work-pools/) &mdash; run flows on your serverless infrastructure without running a worker.

## User accounts

When you sign up for Prefect Cloud, an account and a user profile are automatically provisioned for you.

Your profile is the place where you'll manage settings related to yourself as a user, including:

- Profile, including profile handle and image
- API keys
- Preferences, including timezone and color mode

As an account Admin, you will also have access to account settings from the Account Settings page, such as:

- Members
- Workspaces
- Roles

As an account Admin you can create a [workspace](#workspaces) and invite other individuals to your workspace.

Upgrading from a Prefect Cloud Free tier plan to a Pro or Enterprise tier plan enables additional functionality for adding workspaces, managing teams, and running higher volume workloads.

Workspace Admins have the ability to use [single sign-on (SSO)](#single-sign-on-(sso)), set [role-based access controls (RBAC)](#roles-and-custom-permissions), view [Audit Logs](#audit-log), and configure [service accounts](#service-accounts).

Enterprise add [custom roles](/2.15/cloud/users/roles/), [object-level access control lists](/2.15/cloud/users/object-access-control-lists/), [teams](/2.15/cloud/users/teams/), and [Directory Sync/SCIM provisioning](/2.15/cloud/users/sso/#scim-provisioning) for SSO.

!!! cloud-ad "Prefect Cloud plans for teams of every size"
    See the [Prefect Cloud plans](https://www.prefect.io/pricing/) for details on Pro and Enterprise account tiers.

## Workspaces

A workspace is an isolated environment within Prefect Cloud for your flows, deployments, and block configuration.
See the [Workspaces](/2.15/cloud/workspaces/) documentation for more information about configuring and using workspaces.

Each workspace keeps track of its own:

- [Flow runs](/2.15/concepts/flows/) and task runs executed in an environment that is [syncing with the workspace](/2.15/cloud/workspaces/)
- [Flows](/2.15/concepts/flows/) associated with flow runs and deployments observed by the Prefect Cloud API
- [Deployments](/2.15/concepts/deployments/)
- [Work pools](/2.15/concepts/work-pools/)
- [Blocks](/2.15/concepts/blocks/) and [storage](/2.15/concepts/storage/)
- [Events](/2.15/cloud/events/)
- [Automations](/2.15/concepts/automations/)
- [Incidents](/2.15/cloud/incidents/)

![Viewing a workspace dashboard in the Prefect Cloud UI.](/2.15/2.15/img/ui/cloud-new-workspace.png)

## Events

Prefect Cloud allows you to see your [events](/2.15/cloud/events/). Events provide information about the state of your workflows, and can be used as [automation](/2.15/concepts/automations/) triggers.

![Prefect UI](/2.15/2.15/img/ui/event-feed.png)

## Automations

Prefect Cloud [automations](/2.15/concepts/automations/) provide additional notification capabilities beyond those in a self-hosted open-source Prefect server.
Automations also enable you to create event-driven workflows, toggle resources such as schedules and work pools, and declare incidents.

## Incidents <span class="badge pro"></span> <span class="badge enterprise"></span> <span class="badge beta"/>

Prefect Cloud's [incidents](/2.15/cloud/incidents/) help teams identify, rectify, and document issues in mission-critical workflows.
Incidents are formal declarations of disruptions to a workspace.
With [automations](/2.15/cloud/incidents/#incident-automations)), activity in that workspace can be paused when an incident is created and resumed when it is resolved.

## Error summaries

Prefect Cloud error summaries, enabled by Marvin AI, distill the error logs of `Failed` and `Crashed` flow runs into actionable information.
To enable this feature and others powered by Marvin AI, visit the **Settings** page for your account.

## Service accounts <span class="badge pro"></span> <span class="badge enterprise"></span>

Service accounts enable you to create Prefect Cloud API keys that are not associated with a user account.
Service accounts are typically used to configure API access for running workers or executing flow runs on remote infrastructure.
See the [service accounts](/2.15/cloud/users/service-accounts/) documentation for more information about creating and managing service accounts.

## Roles and custom permissions <span class="badge pro"> </span><span class="badge enterprise"></span>

Role-based access controls (RBAC) enable you to assign users a role with permissions to perform certain activities within an account or a workspace.
See the [role-based access controls (RBAC)](/2.15/cloud/users/roles/) documentation for more information about managing user roles in a Prefect Cloud account.

## Single Sign-on (SSO) <span class="badge pro"></span> <span class="badge enterprise"></span>

Prefect Cloud's [Pro and Enterprise plans](https://www.prefect.io/pricing) offer [single sign-on (SSO)](/2.15/cloud/users/sso/) authentication integration with your team’s identity provider.
SSO integration can bet set up with identity providers that support OIDC and SAML.
Directory Sync and SCIM provisioning is also available with Enterprise plans.

## Audit log <span class="badge pro"></span> <span class="badge enterprise"></span>

Prefect Cloud's [Pro and Enterprise plans](https://www.prefect.io/pricing) offer [Audit Logs](/2.15/cloud/users/audit-log/) for compliance and security.
Audit logs provide a chronological record of activities performed by users in an account.

## Prefect Cloud REST API

The [Prefect REST API](/2.15/api-ref/rest-api/) is used for communicating data from Prefect clients to Prefect Cloud or a local Prefect server for orchestration and monitoring.
This API is mainly consumed by Prefect clients like the Prefect Python Client or the Prefect UI.

!!! note "Prefect Cloud REST API interactive documentation"
    Prefect Cloud REST API documentation is available at <a href="https://app.prefect.cloud/api/docs" target="_blank">https://app.prefect.cloud/api/docs</a>.

## Start using Prefect Cloud

To create an account or sign in with an existing Prefect Cloud account, go to [https://app.prefect.cloud/](https://app.prefect.cloud/).

Then follow the steps in the UI to deploy your first Prefect Cloud-monitored flow run. For more details, see the [Prefect Quickstart](/2.15/getting-started/quickstart/) and follow the instructions on the **Cloud** tabs.
