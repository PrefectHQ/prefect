Integrations to extend Prefect's functionality with Redis.

## Getting started

### Install `prefect-redis`

The following command will install a version of `prefect-redis` compatible with your installed version of `prefect`. 
If you don't already have `prefect` installed, it will install the newest version of `prefect` as well.

```bash
pip install "prefect[redis]"
```

Upgrade to the latest versions of `prefect` and `prefect-redis`:

```bash
pip install -U "prefect[redis]"
```

### Register newly installed block types

Register the block types in the `prefect-redis` module to make them available for use.

```bash
prefect block register -m prefect_redis
```
