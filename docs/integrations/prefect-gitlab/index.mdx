The prefect-gitlab library makes it easy to interact with GitLab repositories and credentials.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- A [GitLab account](https://gitlab.com/).

### Install `prefect-gitlab`

The following command will install a version of `prefect-gitlab` compatible with your installed version of `prefect`. 
If you don't already have `prefect` installed, it will install the newest version of `prefect` as well.

```bash
pip install "prefect[gitlab]"
```

Upgrade to the latest versions of `prefect` and `prefect-gitlab`:

```bash
pip install -U "prefect[gitlab]"
```

### Register newly installed block types

Register the block types in the `prefect-gitlab` module to make them available for use.

```bash
prefect block register -m prefect_gitlab
```

## Examples

In the examples below, you create blocks with Python code.
Alternatively, blocks can be created through the Prefect UI.

## Store deployment flow code in a private GitLab repository

To create a deployment where the flow code is stored in a private GitLab repository, you can use the `GitLabCredentials` block.

A deployment can use flow code stored in a GitLab repository without using this library in either of the following cases:

- The repository is public
- The deployment uses a [Secret block](https://docs.prefect.io/latest/develop/blocks/) to store the token

Code to create a GitLab Credentials block:

```python
from prefect_gitlab import GitLabCredentials


gitlab_credentials_block = GitLabCredentials(token="my_token")
gitlab_credentials_block.save(name="my-gitlab-credentials-block")
```

### Access flow code stored in a private GitLab repository in a deployment

Use the credentials block you created above to pass the GitLab access token during deployment creation. The code below assumes there's flow code in your private GitLab repository.

```python
from prefect import flow
from prefect.runner.storage import GitRepository
from prefect_gitlab import GitLabCredentials


if __name__ == "__main__":

    source = GitRepository(
        url="https://gitlab.com/org/private-repo.git",
        credentials=GitLabCredentials.load("my-gitlab-credentials-block")
    )

    source = GitRepository(
    flow.from_source(
        source=source,
        entrypoint="my_file.py:my_flow",
    ).deploy(
        name="private-gitlab-deploy",
        work_pool_name="my_pool",
    )
```

Alternatively, if you use a `prefect.yaml` file to create the deployment, reference the GitLab Credentials block in the `pull` step:

```yaml
pull:
    - prefect.deployments.steps.git_clone:
        repository: https://github.com/org/repo.git
        credentials: "{{ prefect.blocks.gitlab-credentials.my-gitlab-credentials-block }}"
```

### Interact with a GitLab repository

The code below shows how to reference a particular branch or tag of a GitLab repository.

```python
from prefect_gitlab import GitLabRepository


def save_private_gitlab_block():
    private_gitlab_block = GitLabRepository(
        repository="https://gitlab.com/testing/my-repository.git",
        access_token="YOUR_GITLAB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN",
        reference="branch-or-tag-name",
    )

    private_gitlab_block.save("my-private-gitlab-block")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    save_private_gitlab_block()
```

Exclude the `access_token` field if the repository is public and exclude the `reference` field to use the default branch.

Use the newly created block to interact with the GitLab repository.

For example, download the repository contents with the `.get_directory()` method like this:

```python
from prefect_gitlab.repositories import GitLabRepository


def fetch_repo():
    private_gitlab_block = GitLabRepository.load("my-gitlab-block")
    private_gitlab_block.get_directory()


if __name__ == "__main__":
    fetch_repo()
```
