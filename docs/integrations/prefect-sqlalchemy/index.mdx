# prefect-sqlalchemy

The prefect-sqlalchemy helps you connect to a database in your Prefect flows. 

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Prefect 3 installed](/3.0rc/get-started/install/).

### Install `prefect-sqlalchemy`

```bash
pip install -U prefect-sqlalchemy
```

### Register newly installed block types

Register the block types in the prefect-sqlalchemy module to make them available for use.


```bash
prefect block register -m prefect_sqlalchemy
```

## Examples

### Save credentials to a block

To use the `load` method on Blocks, you must have a block saved through code or saved through the UI.


```python
from prefect_sqlalchemy import SqlAlchemyConnector, ConnectionComponents, SyncDriver

connector = SqlAlchemyConnector(
    connection_info=ConnectionComponents(
        driver=SyncDriver.POSTGRESQL_PSYCOPG2,
        username="USERNAME-PLACEHOLDER",
        password="PASSWORD-PLACEHOLDER",
        host="localhost",
        port=5432,
        database="DATABASE-PLACEHOLDER",
    )
)

connector.save("BLOCK_NAME-PLACEHOLDER")
```

Load the saved block that holds your credentials:

```python
from prefect_sqlalchemy import SqlAlchemyConnector

SqlAlchemyConnector.load("BLOCK_NAME-PLACEHOLDER")
```

The required arguments depend upon the desired driver. For example, SQLite requires only the `driver` and `database` arguments:

```python
from prefect_sqlalchemy import SqlAlchemyConnector, ConnectionComponents, SyncDriver

connector = SqlAlchemyConnector(
    connection_info=ConnectionComponents(
        driver=SyncDriver.SQLITE_PYSQLITE,
        database="DATABASE-PLACEHOLDER.db"
    )
)

connector.save("BLOCK_NAME-PLACEHOLDER")
```

### Work with databases in a flow

To set up a table, use the `execute` and `execute_many` methods. 

Use the `fetch_many` method to retrieve data in a stream until there's no more data.

Use the `SqlAlchemyConnector` as a context manager, to ensure that the SQLAlchemy engine and any connected resources are closed properly after you're done with them.


<Note>

**Async support**

`SqlAlchemyConnector`  supports async workflows. Just be sure to save, load, and use an async driver, as in the example below.

```python
from prefect_sqlalchemy import SqlAlchemyConnector, ConnectionComponents, AsyncDriver

connector = SqlAlchemyConnector(
    connection_info=ConnectionComponents(
        driver=AsyncDriver.SQLITE_AIOSQLITE,
        database="DATABASE-PLACEHOLDER.db"
    )
)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    connector.save("BLOCK_NAME-PLACEHOLDER")
```
