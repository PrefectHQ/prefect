## Welcome!

The prefect-snowflake collection makes it easy to connect to a Snowflake database in your Prefect flows. Check out the examples below to get started!

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- [Prefect installed](/3.0/get-started/install/).

### Install prefect-snowflake

The following command will install a version of `prefect-snowflake` compatible with your installed version of `prefect`.
If you don't already have `prefect` installed, it will install the newest version of `prefect` as well.

```bash
pip install "prefect[snowflake]"
```

Upgrade to the latest versions of `prefect` and `prefect-snowflake`:

```bash
pip install -U "prefect[snowflake]"
```

### Integrate with Prefect flows

Prefect works with Snowflake by providing dataflow automation for faster, more efficient data pipeline creation, execution, and monitoring.

This results in reduced errors, increased confidence in your data, and ultimately, faster insights.

To set up a table, use the `execute` and `execute_many` methods. Then, use the `fetch_many` method to retrieve data in a stream until there's no more data.

By using the `SnowflakeConnector` as a context manager, you can make sure that the Snowflake connection and cursors are closed properly after you're done with them.

Be sure to [install prefect-snowflake](#installation), [register the blocks](#registering-blocks), and [create a credentials block](#saving-credentials-to-block) to run the examples below!

=== "Sync"

    ```python
    from prefect import flow, task
    from prefect_snowflake import SnowflakeConnector


    @task
    def setup_table(block_name: str) -> None:
        with SnowflakeConnector.load(block_name) as connector:
            connector.execute(
                "CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS customers (name varchar, address varchar);"
            )
            connector.execute_many(
                "INSERT INTO customers (name, address) VALUES (%(name)s, %(address)s);",
                seq_of_parameters=[
                    {"name": "Ford", "address": "Highway 42"},
                    {"name": "Unknown", "address": "Space"},
                    {"name": "Me", "address": "Myway 88"},
                ],
            )

    @task
    def fetch_data(block_name: str) -> list:
        all_rows = []
        with SnowflakeConnector.load(block_name) as connector:
            while True:
                # Repeated fetch* calls using the same operation will
                # skip re-executing and instead return the next set of results
                new_rows = connector.fetch_many("SELECT * FROM customers", size=2)
                if len(new_rows) == 0:
                    break
                all_rows.append(new_rows)
        return all_rows

    @flow
    def snowflake_flow(block_name: str) -> list:
        setup_table(block_name)
        all_rows = fetch_data(block_name)
        return all_rows


    if __name__=="__main__":
        snowflake_flow()
    ```

=== "Async"

    ```python
    from prefect import flow, task
    from prefect_snowflake import SnowflakeConnector
    import asyncio


    @task
    async def setup_table(block_name: str) -> None:
        with await SnowflakeConnector.load(block_name) as connector:
            await connector.execute(
                "CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS customers (name varchar, address varchar);"
            )
            await connector.execute_many(
                "INSERT INTO customers (name, address) VALUES (%(name)s, %(address)s);",
                seq_of_parameters=[
                    {"name": "Ford", "address": "Highway 42"},
                    {"name": "Unknown", "address": "Space"},
                    {"name": "Me", "address": "Myway 88"},
                ],
            )

    @task
    async def fetch_data(block_name: str) -> list:
        all_rows = []
        with await SnowflakeConnector.load(block_name) as connector:
            while True:
                # Repeated fetch* calls using the same operation will
                # skip re-executing and instead return the next set of results
                new_rows = await connector.fetch_many("SELECT * FROM customers", size=2)
                if len(new_rows) == 0:
                    break
                all_rows.append(new_rows)
        return all_rows

    @flow
    async def snowflake_flow(block_name: str) -> list:
        await setup_table(block_name)
        all_rows = await fetch_data(block_name)
        return all_rows


    if __name__=="__main__":
        asyncio.run(snowflake_flow("example"))
    ```

### Access underlying Snowflake connection

If the native methods of the block don't meet your requirements, don't worry.

You have the option to access the underlying Snowflake connection and utilize its built-in methods as well.

```python
import pandas as pd
from prefect import flow
from prefect_snowflake.database import SnowflakeConnector
from snowflake.connector.pandas_tools import write_pandas


@flow
def snowflake_write_pandas_flow():
    connector = SnowflakeConnector.load("my-block")
    with connector.get_connection() as connection:
        table_name = "TABLE_NAME"
        ddl = "NAME STRING, NUMBER INT"
        statement = f'CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS {table_name} ({ddl})'
        with connection.cursor() as cursor:
            cursor.execute(statement)

        # case sensitivity matters here!
        df = pd.DataFrame([('Marvin', 42), ('Ford', 88)], columns=['NAME', 'NUMBER'])
        success, num_chunks, num_rows, _ = write_pandas(
            conn=connection,
            df=df,
            table_name=table_name,
            database=snowflake_connector.database,
            schema=snowflake_connector.schema_  # note the "_" suffix
        )
```



### Installation

Install `prefect-snowflake` with `pip`:

```bash
pip install prefect-snowflake
```

### Registering blocks
Register blocks in this module to make them available for use.

```bash
prefect block register -m prefect_snowflake
```

### Saving credentials to a block

Note, to use the `load` method on a block, you must already have a block saved through code or saved through the UI.

Below is a walkthrough on saving a `SnowflakeCredentials` block through code.

1. Head over to https://app.snowflake.com/.
2. Login to your Snowflake account, for example: nh12345.us-east-2.snowflake, with your username and password.
3. Use those credentials to fill replace the placeholders below.

```python
from prefect_snowflake import SnowflakeCredentials


credentials = SnowflakeCredentials(
    account="ACCOUNT-PLACEHOLDER",  # resembles nh12345.us-east-2.snowflake
    user="USER-PLACEHOLDER",
    password="PASSWORD-PLACEHOLDER"
)
credentials.save("CREDENTIALS-BLOCK-NAME-PLACEHOLDER")
```

Then, to create a `SnowflakeConnector` block:

1. After logging in, click on any worksheet.
2. On the left side, select a database and schema.
3. On the top right, select a warehouse.
3. Create a short script, replacing the placeholders below.

```python
from prefect_snowflake import SnowflakeCredentials, SnowflakeConnector

credentials = SnowflakeCredentials.load("CREDENTIALS-BLOCK-NAME-PLACEHOLDER")

connector = SnowflakeConnector(
    credentials=credentials,
    database="DATABASE-PLACEHOLDER",
    schema="SCHEMA-PLACEHOLDER",
    warehouse="COMPUTE_WH",
)
connector.save("CONNECTOR-BLOCK-NAME-PLACEHOLDER")
```

You can now easily load the saved block, which holds your credentials and connection info:

```python
from prefect_snowflake import SnowflakeCredentials, SnowflakeConnector


SnowflakeCredentials.load("CREDENTIALS-BLOCK-NAME-PLACEHOLDER")
SnowflakeConnector.load("CONNECTOR-BLOCK-NAME-PLACEHOLDER")
```

<Info>
**Registering blocks**

Register blocks in this module to view and edit them on Prefect Cloud:

```bash
prefect block register -m prefect_snowflake
```
