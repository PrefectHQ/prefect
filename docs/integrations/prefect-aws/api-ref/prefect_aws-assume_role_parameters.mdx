Module handling Assume Role parameters

## Classes

### `AssumeRoleParameters` <sup><a href="https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect/blob/main/src/integrations/prefect-aws/prefect_aws/assume_role_parameters.py#L10" target="_blank"><Icon icon="github" style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" /></a></sup>


Model used to manage parameters for the AWS STS assume_role call.
Refer to the
[boto3 STS assume_role docs](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/sts/client/assume_role.html)
for more information about the possible assume role configurations.

**Attributes:**
- `RoleSessionName`: An identifier for the assumed role session.
This value is used to uniquely identify a session when the same role
is assumed by different principals or for different reasons.
If not provided, a default will be generated.
- `DurationSeconds`: The duration, in seconds, of the role session.
The value can range from 900 seconds (15 minutes) to 43,200 seconds (12 hours).
- `Policy`: An IAM policy in JSON format that you want to use as an inline session policy.
- `PolicyArns`: The ARNs of the IAM managed policies to use as managed session policies.
Each item should be a dict with an 'arn' key.
- `Tags`: A list of session tags. Each tag should be a dict with 'Key' and 'Value' keys.
- `TransitiveTagKeys`: A list of keys for session tags that you want to set as transitive.
Transitive tags persist during role chaining.
- `ExternalId`: A unique identifier that is used by third parties to assume a role
in their customers' accounts.
- `SerialNumber`: The identification number of the MFA device that is associated
with the user who is making the AssumeRole call.
- `TokenCode`: The value provided by the MFA device, if MFA authentication is required.
- `SourceIdentity`: The source identity specified by the principal that is calling
the AssumeRole operation.
- `ProvidedContexts`: A list of context information. Each context should be a dict
with 'ProviderArn' and 'ContextAssertion' keys.


**Methods:**

#### `get_params_override` <sup><a href="https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect/blob/main/src/integrations/prefect-aws/prefect_aws/assume_role_parameters.py#L141" target="_blank"><Icon icon="github" style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" /></a></sup>

```python
get_params_override(self) -> Dict[str, Any]
```

Return the dictionary of the parameters to override.
The parameters to override are the ones which are not None.
