## Functions

### `aclient_waiter` <sup><a href="https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect/blob/main/src/integrations/prefect-aws/prefect_aws/client_waiter.py#L15" target="_blank"><Icon icon="github" style="width: 14px; height: 14px;" /></a></sup>

```python
aclient_waiter(client: str, waiter_name: str, aws_credentials: AwsCredentials, waiter_definition: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None, **waiter_kwargs: Optional[Dict[str, Any]])
```


Asynchronously uses the underlying boto3 waiter functionality.

**Args:**
- `client`: The AWS client on which to wait (e.g., 'client_wait', 'ec2', etc).
- `waiter_name`: The name of the waiter to instantiate.
You may also use a custom waiter name, if you supply
an accompanying waiter definition dict.
- `aws_credentials`: Credentials to use for authentication with AWS.
- `waiter_definition`: A valid custom waiter model, as a dict. Note that if
you supply a custom definition, it is assumed that the provided
'waiter_name' is contained within the waiter definition dict.
- `**waiter_kwargs`: Arguments to pass to the `waiter.wait(...)` method. Will
depend upon the specific waiter being called.
