```python
ecs(work_pool: str, include_files: Sequence[str] | None = None, **job_variables: Any) -> Callable[[Flow[P, R]], InfrastructureBoundFlow[P, R]]
```


Decorator that binds execution of a flow to an ECS work pool

**Args:**
- `work_pool`: The name of the ECS work pool to use
- `include_files`: Optional sequence of file patterns to include in the bundle.
Patterns are relative to the flow file location. Supports glob patterns
(e.g., "*.yaml", "data/**/*.csv"). Files matching these patterns will
be bundled and available in the remote execution environment.
- `**job_variables`: Additional job variables to use for infrastructure configuration
