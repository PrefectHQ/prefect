The `prefect-docker` library is required to create deployments that will submit runs to most Prefect work pool infrastructure types.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- [Docker installed](https://www.docker.com/) and running.

### Install `prefect-docker`

The following command will install a version of `prefect-docker` compatible with your installed version of `prefect`.
If you don't already have `prefect` installed, it will install the newest version of `prefect` as well.

```bash
pip install "prefect[docker]"
```

Upgrade to the latest versions of `prefect` and `prefect-docker`:

```bash
pip install -U "prefect[docker]"
```
### Examples
See the Prefect [Workers docs](/v3/how-to-guides/deployment_infra/docker) to learn how to create and run deployments that use Docker.

## Resources

For assistance using Docker, consult the [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/).

Refer to the `prefect-docker` [SDK documentation](https://reference.prefect.io/prefect_docker/) to explore all the capabilities of the `prefect-docker` library.
