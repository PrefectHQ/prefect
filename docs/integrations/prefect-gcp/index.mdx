`prefect-gcp` helps you leverage the capabilities of Google Cloud Platform (GCP) in your workflows.
For example, you can run flow on Vertex AI or Cloud Run, read and write data to BigQuery and Cloud Storage, retrieve secrets with Secret Manager.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- [Prefect installed](3.0rc/get-started/install) in a virtual environment.
- A [GCP account](https://cloud.google.com/) and the necessary permissions to access desired services.

### Install prefect-gcp


Install or update to the latest version of the prefect-gcp library and dependencies.

<Tabs>
    <Tab title="Prefect 2">
    ```bash
    pip install -U prefect-gcp
    ```
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="Prefect 3">
    ```bash
    pip install -U -pre prefect-gcp
    ```
    </Tab>
</Tabs>


If using BigQuery, Cloud Storage, Secret Manager, or Vertex AI, see [additional installation options](#additional-installation-options).

To install with all additional functionality, use the following command:


```bash
pip install -U "prefect-gcp[all_extras]"
```


### Register newly installed block types

Register the block types in the module to make them available for use.

```bash
prefect block register -m prefect_gcp
```


## Authenticate using a GCP Credentials block

Authenticate with a service account to use `prefect-gcp` services.

1. Refer to the [GCP service account documentation](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-account-keys#creating) to create and download a service account key file.
2. Copy the JSON contents.
3. Use the Python code below, replace the placeholders with your information.

```python
from prefect_gcp import GcpCredentials

# replace this PLACEHOLDER dict with your own service account info
service_account_info = {
  "type": "service_account",
  "project_id": "PROJECT_ID",
  "private_key_id": "KEY_ID",
  "private_key": "-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nPRIVATE_KEY\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n",
  "client_email": "SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL",
  "client_id": "CLIENT_ID",
  "auth_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/auth",
  "token_uri": "https://accounts.google.com/o/oauth2/token",
  "auth_provider_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v1/certs",
  "client_x509_cert_url": "https://www.googleapis.com/robot/v1/metadata/x509/SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL"
}

GcpCredentials(
    service_account_info=service_account_info
).save("BLOCK-NAME-PLACEHOLDER")
```

<Warning> 
**`service_account_info` vs `service_account_file`**

The advantage of using `service_account_info`, instead of `service_account_file`, is that it is accessible across containers.

If `service_account_file` is used, the provided file path *must be available* in the container executing the flow.
</Warning>

Alternatively, GCP can authenticate without storing credentials in a block.
See the [Third-pary Secrets docs](/3.0rc/resources/secrets) for an analogous example that uses AWS Secrets Manager and Snowflake.

## Run flows on Google Cloud Run or Vertex AI

Run flows on [Google Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run) or [Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai) to dynamically scale your infrastructure.

See the [Google Cloud Run Worker Guide](integrations/prefect-gcp/gcp-worker-guide/) for a walkthrough of using Google Cloud Run to run workflows with a hybrid work pool.

If you're using Prefect Cloud, [Google Cloud Run push work pools](/3.0rc/deploy/infrastructure-examples/serverless) provide all the benefits of Google Cloud Run along with a quick setup and no worker needed.

### Use Prefect with Google BigQuery

Read data from and write to Google BigQuery within your Prefect flows.

Be sure to [install](#installation) `prefect-gcp` with the BigQuery extra.

This code creates a new dataset in BigQuery, define a table, insert rows, and fetch data from the table:

```python
from prefect import flow
from prefect_gcp.bigquery import GcpCredentials, BigQueryWarehouse

@flow
def bigquery_flow():
    all_rows = []
    gcp_credentials = GcpCredentials.load("BLOCK-NAME-PLACEHOLDER")

    client = gcp_credentials.get_bigquery_client()
    client.create_dataset("test_example", exists_ok=True)

    with BigQueryWarehouse(gcp_credentials=gcp_credentials) as warehouse:
        warehouse.execute(
            "CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS test_example.customers (name STRING, address STRING);"
        )
        warehouse.execute_many(
            "INSERT INTO test_example.customers (name, address) VALUES (%(name)s, %(address)s);",
            seq_of_parameters=[
                {"name": "Marvin", "address": "Highway 42"},
                {"name": "Ford", "address": "Highway 42"},
                {"name": "Unknown", "address": "Highway 42"},
            ],
        )
        while True:
            # Repeated fetch* calls using the same operation will
            # skip re-executing and instead return the next set of results
            new_rows = warehouse.fetch_many("SELECT * FROM test_example.customers", size=2)
            if len(new_rows) == 0:
                break
            all_rows.extend(new_rows)
    return all_rows


if __name__ == "__main__":
    bigquery_flow()
```

## Use Prefect with Google Cloud Storage

Interact with Google Cloud Storage.

Be sure to [install](#install-prefect-gcp) `prefect-gcp` with the Cloud Storage extra.

The code below uses `prefect_gcp` to upload a file to a Google Cloud Storage bucket and download the same file under a different file name.

```python
from pathlib import Path
from prefect import flow
from prefect_gcp import GcpCredentials, GcsBucket


@flow
def cloud_storage_flow():
    # create a dummy file to upload
    file_path = Path("test-example.txt")
    file_path.write_text("Hello, Prefect!")

    gcp_credentials = GcpCredentials.load("BLOCK-NAME-PLACEHOLDER")
    gcs_bucket = GcsBucket(
        bucket="BUCKET-NAME-PLACEHOLDER",
        gcp_credentials=gcp_credentials
    )

    gcs_bucket_path = gcs_bucket.upload_from_path(file_path)
    downloaded_file_path = gcs_bucket.download_object_to_path(
        gcs_bucket_path, "downloaded-test-example.txt"
    )
    return downloaded_file_path.read_text()


if __name__ == "__main__":
    cloud_storage_flow()
```

<Info> 
**Upload and download directories**

`GcsBucket` supports uploading and downloading entire directories.
</Info>

## Save secrets with Google Secret Manager

Read and write secrets with Google Secret Manager.

Be sure to [install](#instal-prefect-gcp) `prefect-gcp` with the Secret Manager extra.

The code below writes a secret to the Secret Manager, reads the secret data, and deletes the secret.

```python
from prefect import flow
from prefect_gcp import GcpCredentials, GcpSecret


@flow
def secret_manager_flow():
    gcp_credentials = GcpCredentials.load("BLOCK-NAME-PLACEHOLDER")
    gcp_secret = GcpSecret(secret_name="test-example", gcp_credentials=gcp_credentials)
    gcp_secret.write_secret(secret_data=b"Hello, Prefect!")
    secret_data = gcp_secret.read_secret()
    gcp_secret.delete_secret()
    return secret_data


if __name__ == "__main__":
    secret_manager_flow()
```

## Access Google credentials or clients from GcpCredentials

You can instantiate a Google Cloud client, such as `bigquery.Client`.

Note that a `GcpCredentials` object is NOT a valid input to the underlying BigQuery client - use the `get_credentials_from_service_account` method to access and pass a `google.auth.Credentials` object.

```python
import google.cloud.bigquery
from prefect import flow
from prefect_gcp import GcpCredentials

@flow
def create_bigquery_client():
    gcp_credentials = GcpCredentials.load("BLOCK-NAME-PLACEHOLDER")
    google_auth_credentials = gcp_credentials.get_credentials_from_service_account()
    bigquery_client = bigquery.Client(credentials=google_auth_credentials)
```

To access the underlying client, use the `get_client` method from `GcpCredentials`.

```python
from prefect import flow
from prefect_gcp import GcpCredentials

@flow
def create_bigquery_client():
    gcp_credentials = GcpCredentials.load("BLOCK-NAME-PLACEHOLDER")
    bigquery_client = gcp_credentials.get_client("bigquery")
```
