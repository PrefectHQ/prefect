# Introduction

## Welcome to the Prefect Preview!

Thank you for being one of our early partners. Your feedback is critical to making sure Prefect does everything it's supposed to do. You can always reach us at [help@prefect.io]().

We're very excited to share what we've been working on. This first preview release is `v0.3.0`, and includes all the tools for building, testing, and executing workflows locally.

You may find a few dead-ends as you poke around the code -- many of those will become functional when we release our server and execution platforms in future preview releases.



## Overview

Prefect is a new workflow management system designed for modern data infrastructures.

Users organize `Tasks` into `Flows`, and Prefect takes care of the rest! With a minimal but expressive API and intelligent defaults, it stays out of your way until you need it.

## "...Prefect?"

From the Latin *praefectus*, meaning "one who is in charge", a prefect is an official who oversees a domain and ensures that work is done correctly.

It also happens to be the name of a roving researcher for that wholly remarkable book, *The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy*.
