When running workflow applications, it's helpful to create long-running processes that
run at startup and are resilient to failure.

This guide shows you how to set up a systemd service to create long-running Prefect processes
that poll for scheduled flow runs, including how to:

* create a Linux user
* install and configure Prefect
* set up a systemd service for the Prefect worker or `.serve` process

## Prerequisites

* An environment with a linux operating system with [systemd](https://systemd.io/) and Python 3.9
or later.
* A superuser account that can run `sudo` commands.
* A Prefect Cloud account, or an instance of a Prefect server running on your network.

If using an [AWS t2-micro EC2 instance](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/t2/) with an
AWS Linux image, you can install Python and pip with `sudo yum install -y python3 python3-pip`.

## Steps

A systemd service is ideal for running a long-lived process on a Linux VM or physical Linux server.
You will use systemd and learn how to automatically start a
[Prefect worker](/3.0/deploy/infrastructure-concepts/workers/) or
long-lived [`serve` process](/3.0/develop/write-flows/#serving-a-flow) when Linux starts.
This approach provides resilience by automatically restarting the process if it crashes.

### Step 1: Add a user

Create a user account on your Linux system for the Prefect process.
You can run a worker or serve process as root, but it's best practice to create a dedicated user.

In a terminal, run:

```bash
sudo useradd -m prefect
sudo passwd prefect
```

When prompted, enter a password for the `prefect` account.

Next, log in to the `prefect` account by running:

```bash
sudo su prefect
```

### Step 2: Install Prefect

Run:

```bash
pip3 install prefect
```

This guide assumes you are installing Prefect globally, rather than a virtual environment.
If running a systemd service in a virtual environment, change the ExecPath.
For example, if using [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html), change the ExecPath
to target the `prefect` application in the `bin` subdirectory of your virtual environment.

Next, set up your environment so the Prefect client knows which server to connect to.

If connecting to Prefect Cloud, follow [the instructions](https://docs.prefect.io/ui/cloud-get-started/#create-an-api-key)
to obtain an API key, and then run the following:

```bash
prefect cloud login -k YOUR_API_KEY
```

When prompted, choose the Prefect workspace to log in to.

If connecting to a self-hosted Prefect server instance instead of a Prefect Cloud account, run the following command, substituting the IP address of your server:

```bash
prefect config set PREFECT_API_URL=http://your-prefect-server-IP:4200
```

Run the `exit` command to sign out of the `prefect` Linux account.
This command switches you back to your sudo-enabled account where you can run the commands in the
next section.

### Step 3: Set up a systemd service

See the section below if you are setting up a Prefect worker.
Skip to the [next section](#setting-up-a-systemd-service-for-serve) if you are setting up a
Prefect `.serve` process.

#### Setting up a systemd service for a Prefect worker

Move into the `/etc/systemd/system` folder and open a file for editing.
We use the Vim text editor below.

```bash
cd /etc/systemd/system
sudo vim my-prefect-service.service
```

```txt my-prefect-service.service
[Unit]
Description=Prefect worker

[Service]
User=prefect
WorkingDirectory=/home
ExecStart=prefect worker start --pool YOUR_WORK_POOL_NAME
Restart=always

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Make sure you substitute your own work pool name.

#### Setting up a systemd service for `.serve`

Copy your flow entrypoint Python file and any other files needed for your flow to run into the
`/home` directory (or the directory of your choice).

Here's a basic example flow:

```python my_file.py
from prefect import flow


@flow(log_prints=True)
def say_hi():
    print("Hello!")

if __name__=="__main__":
    say_hi.serve(name="served and daemonized deployment")
```

To make changes to your flow code without restarting your process, push your
code to git-based cloud storage (GitHub, BitBucket, GitLab) and use `flow.from_source().serve()`,
as in the example below.

```python my_remote_flow_code_file.py
if __name__ == "__main__":
    flow.from_source(
        source="https://github.com/org/repo.git",
        entrypoint="path/to/my_remote_flow_code_file.py:say_hi",
    ).serve(name="deployment-with-github-storage")
```

Make sure you substitute your own flow code entrypoint path.

If you change the flow entrypoint parameters, you must restart the process.

Move into the `/etc/systemd/system` folder and open a file for editing.
This example below uses Vim.

```bash
cd /etc/systemd/system
sudo vim my-prefect-service.service
```

```txt my-prefect-service.service
[Unit]
Description=Prefect serve

[Service]
User=prefect
WorkingDirectory=/home
ExecStart=python3 my_file.py
Restart=always

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

### Step 4: Save, enable, and start the service

To save the file and exit Vim, hit the escape key, type `:wq!`, then press the return key.

Next, make systemd aware of your new service by running:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

Then, enable the service by running:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable my-prefect-service
```

This command ensures it runs when your system boots.

Next, start the service:

```bash
sudo systemctl start my-prefect-service
```

Run your deployment from the UI and check the logs on the **Flow Runs** page.

You can see if your daemonized Prefect worker or serve process is running, and the
Prefect logs with `systemctl status my-prefect-service`.

You now have a systemd service that starts when your system boots, which will restart if it ever crashes.
