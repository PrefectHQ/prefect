import fork from '/snippets/fork.mdx'


We use [Mintlify](https://mintlify.com/) to host and build the Prefect documentation.

The main branch of the [prefecthq/prefect](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect) GitHub repository is used to build the Prefect 3.0 docs at [docs-3.prefect.io](https://docs-3.prefect.io).

The 2.x docs are hosted at [docs-2.prefect.io](https://docs-2.prefect.io) and built from the 2.x branch of the repository.

## Fork the repository

<fork />

## Set up your local environment

Make sure you have a recent version of Node.js installed. 
We recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage Node.js versions.

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `cd docs` to navigate to the docs directory.
3. Run `nvm use node` to use the correct Node.js version.
4. Run `npm i -g mintlify` to install Mintlify.
5. Run `mintlify dev` to start the development server.

Your docs should now be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

See the [Mintlify documentation](https://mintlify.com/docs/development) for more information on how to install Mintlify, build previews, and use Mintlify's features while writing docs.

<Info>All documentation is written in `.mdx` files, which are Markdown files that can contain JavaScript and React components. </Info>

## Considerations

Keep in mind the following when writing documentation.

### External references

Prefect resources can be managed in several ways, including through the CLI, UI, Terraform, Helm, and API.

When documenting a resource, consider including external references that describe how to manage the resource in other ways.
Snippets are available to provide these references in a consistent format.

For example, the [Deployment documentation](/v3/deploy) includes a snippet for the Terraform provider:

```javascript
import { TF } from "/snippets/resource-management/terraform.mdx"
import { deployments } from "/snippets/resource-management/vars.mdx"

<TF name="deployments" href={deployments.tf} />
```

For more information on how to use snippets, see the [Mintlify documentation](https://mintlify.com/docs/reusable-snippets).
