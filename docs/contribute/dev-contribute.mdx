## Make a code contribution

We welcome all forms of contributions to Prefect, whether it's small typo fixes in [our documentation](/contribute/docs-contribute), bug fixes or feature enhancements!
If this is your first time making an open source contribution we will be glad to work with you and help you get up to speed.

<Note>
For small changes such as typo fixes you can simply open a pull request - we typically review small changes like these within the day.
For larger changes including all bug fixes, we ask that you first open [an issue](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect/issues) or comment on the issue that you are planning to work on.
</Note>

## Fork the repository
<fork />

## Install Prefect for development

Once you have cloned your fork of the repo:
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/GITHUB-USERNAME/prefect.git
cd prefect
```
you can install [an editable version](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/development_mode.html) of Prefect for quick iteration.
We recommend using a virtual environment such as `venv`:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# Installs the package with development dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

To ensure your changes comply with our linting policies, you can optionally set up pre-commit hooks to run with every commit:

```
pre-commit install
```

If you don't want to install the pre-commit hooks, you can manually install the linting utilities and run them yourself:

```bash
pip install $(./scripts/precommit-versions.py)

ruff check
ruff format
```

## Write tests

Prefect relies on unit testing to ensure proposed changes don't negatively impact any functionality.
For all code changes, including bug fixes, we ask that you write at least one corresponding test.
One rule of thumb - especially for bug fixes - is that you should write a test that fails prior to your changes and passes with your changes.
This ensures the test will fail and prevent the bug from resurfacing if other changes are made in the future.
All tests can be found in the `tests/` directory of the repository.

You can run the test suite with `pytest`:

```bash
# run all tests
pytest tests

# run a specific file
pytest tests/test_flows.py

# run all tests that match a pattern
pytest -k 'tasks'
```

## Working with a development UI

If you plan to use the UI during development, you will need to build a development version of the UI first.

Using the Prefect UI in development requires installation of [npm](https://github.com/npm/cli).
We recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage Node.js versions.
Once installed, run `nvm use` from the root of the Prefect repository to initialize the proper version of `npm` and `node`.

Start a development UI that reloads on code changes:

```bash
prefect dev ui
```

This command is most useful if you are working directly on the UI codebase.

Alternatively, you can build a static UI that will be served when running `prefect server start`:

```bash
prefect dev build-ui
```

## Working with a development server

The Prefect CLI provides several helpful commands to aid development of server-side changes.

You can start all services with hot-reloading on code changes (note that this requires installation of UI dependencies):

```bash
prefect dev start
```

Start a Prefect API that reloads on code changes:

```bash
prefect dev api
```

## Add database migrations

If your code changes necessitate modifications to a database table, first update the SQLAlchemy model in `src/prefect/server/database/orm_models.py`.

For example, to add a new column to the `flow_run` table, add a new column to the `FlowRun` model:

```python
# src/prefect/server/database/orm_models.py

class FlowRun(Run):
    """SQLAlchemy model of a flow run."""
    ...
    new_column: Mapped[Union[str, None]] = mapped_column(sa.String, nullable=True) # <-- add this line
```

Next, generate new migration files.
Generate a new migration file for each database type.

Migrations are generated for whichever database type `PREFECT_API_DATABASE_CONNECTION_URL` is set to.
See [how to set the database connection URL](/3.0/manage/self-host#database-settings) for each database type.

To generate a new migration file, run:

```bash
prefect server database revision --autogenerate -m "<migration name>"
```

Make the migration name brief but descriptive.
For example:

*   `add_flow_run_new_column`
*   `add_flow_run_new_column_idx`
*   `rename_flow_run_old_column_to_new_column`

The `--autogenerate` flag automatically generates a migration file based on the changes to the models.

<Warning>
**Always inspect the output of `--autogenerate`**

`--autogenerate` generates a migration file based on the changes to the models.
However, it is not perfect. Check the file to ensure it only includes the desired changes.
</Warning>

The new migration is in the `src/prefect/server/database/migrations/versions/` directory. Each database type has its
own subdirectory. For example, the SQLite migrations are stored in `src/prefect/server/database/migrations/versions/sqlite/`.

After inspecting the migration file, apply the migration to the database by running:

```bash
prefect server database upgrade -y
```

After successfully creating migrations for all database types, update `MIGRATION-NOTES.md` to
document the changes.
