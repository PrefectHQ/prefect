Prefect welcomes integration contributions.
Create an integration package for community use by following the steps below.

## Generate a project

To help you create an integration, use [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect-collection-template#quickstart) to bootstrap an integration project. 
The repository uses [Cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/) to generate a project structure. 
The template includes tools for testing, linting, docs, and building the package.

## List your project in the integrations catalog

To list your integration in the Prefect integrations catalog, submit a pull request to the [Prefect GitHub repository](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect).

Add a file to the `docs/integrations/catalog` directory with details about your integration package. 
Use the `TEMPLATE.yaml` file in that folder as a guide.
