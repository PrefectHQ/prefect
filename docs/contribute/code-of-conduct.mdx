title: Code of Conduct
description: Learn about the standards we hold ourselves and our community to.
---

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making 
participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone. This is regardless of age, body size, 
disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, 
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our standards

Examples of behavior that contribute to creating a positive environment include:

*   Using welcoming and inclusive language
*   Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
*   Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
*   Focusing on what is best for the community
*   Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

*   The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
*   Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
*   Public or private harassment
*   Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
*   Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior. They are expected to take appropriate and 
fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, 
and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct. They may ban—temporarily or permanently—any contributor for 
other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces. It also applies when an individual represents the project or its 
community in public spaces. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, 
posting through an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. 
Project maintainers may further clarify what "representation of a project" means.

## Enforcement

Report instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior by contacting Chris White at 
[chris@prefect.io](mailto:chris@prefect.io). All complaints are reviewed and investigated. Each complaint will receive a 
response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain 
confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted 
separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent 
repercussions, as determined by other members of the project's leadership.
