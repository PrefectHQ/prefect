# Running flows with Kubernetes

This guide will walk you through running your flows on Kubernetes. Though much of the guide is general to any Kubernetes cluster, there are differences between the managed Kubernetes offerings between cloud providers, especially when it comes to container registries and access management. We'll focus on Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS).

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, there are a few pre-requisites:

1. A Prefect Cloud account
2. A cloud provider (AWS, GCP, or Azure) account
3. [Install](/getting-started/installation/) Python and Prefect

!!! Note "Administrator Access"
    Though not strictly necessary, you may want to ensure you have admin access, both in Prefect Cloud and in your cloud provider. Admin access is only necessary during the initial setup and can be downgraded after. 

## Create a cluster

Let's start by creating a new cluster. If you already have one, skip ahead to the next section.

=== "AWS"

    One easy way to get set up with a cluster in EKS is with [`eksctl`](https://eksctl.io/). Node pools can be backed by either EC2 instances or FARGATE. Let's choose FARGATE so there's less to manage. The following command takes around 15 minutes and must not be interrupted:

    ```bash
    # Replace the cluster name with your own value
    eksctl create cluster --fargate --name <CLUSTER-NAME>
    ```

<!-- === "GCP"
    TODO

=== "Azure"
    TODO -->

## Create a container registry

Besides a cluster, the other critical resource we'll need is a container registry. This is also not strictly required, but in most cases you'll want to use custom images and/or have more control over where images are stored. If you already have one, skip ahead to the next section.

=== "AWS"

    Let's create a registry using the AWS CLI and authenticate the docker daemon to said registry:

    ```bash
    # Replace the image name with your own value
    aws ecr create-repository --repository-name <IMAGE-NAME>

    # Login to ECR
    # Replace the region and account ID with your own values
    aws ecr get-login-password --region <REGION> | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin <AWS_ACCOUNT_ID>.dkr.ecr.<REGION>.amazonaws.com
    ```

<!-- === "GCP"
    TODO

=== "Azure"
    TODO -->

## Create a work pool

Now let's switch over to Prefect Cloud, where we'll create a new work pool. Hit the plus button on the work pools page and choose Kubernetes from the list of options. On the next page, set Finished Job TTL to 60 so that completed flow runs are cleaned up, and set Pod Watch Timeout Seconds to 300, especially if you are using a __serverless__ type node pool since these tend to have longer startup times. You may also want to set a custom namespace, such as `prefect`. Generally you should leave the cluster config blank as the worker will already be provisioned with appropriate access and permissions. Finally, leave the image field blank as we'll override that in each deployment.

## Deploy a worker using Helm

With our cluster and work pool created, it's time to deploy a worker, which will take our flows and run them as Kubernetes jobs. The best way to deploy a worker is using Helm. Follow [this guide](/guides/deployment/helm-worker/) and then come back here.

## Define a flow

Let's start simple with a flow that just logs a message. In a directory named `flows`, create a file named `hello.py` with the following contents:

```py
from prefect import flow, get_run_logger, tags

@flow
def hello(name: str = "Marvin"):
    logger = get_run_logger()
    logger.info(f"Hello, {name}!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    with tags("local"):
        hello()
```

You can run the flow locally with `python hello.py` to verify that it works. Note that we use the `tags` context manager to tag the flow run as `local`. This is not required, but does add some helpful metadata.

## Define a deployment

The [`prefect.yaml`](/concepts/deployments/#managing-deployments) file gets used by the `prefect deploy` command to actually deploy our flows. As a part of that process it will also build and push our image. Create a new file named `prefect.yaml` with the following contents:

```yaml
# Generic metadata about this project
name: flows
prefect-version: 2.11.0

# build section allows you to manage and build docker images
build:
- prefect_docker.deployments.steps.build_docker_image:
    id: build-image
    requires: prefect-docker>=0.3.11
    image_name: "{{ $PREFECT_IMAGE_NAME }}"
    tag: latest
    dockerfile: auto
    platform: "linux/amd64"

# push section allows you to manage if and how this project is uploaded to remote locations
push:
- prefect_docker.deployments.steps.push_docker_image:
    requires: prefect-docker>=0.3.11
    image_name: "{{ build-image.image_name }}"
    tag: "{{ build-image.tag }}"

# pull section allows you to provide instructions for cloning this project in remote locations
pull:
- prefect.deployments.steps.set_working_directory:
    directory: /opt/prefect/flows

# the definitions section allows you to define reusable components for your deployments
definitions:
  tags: &common_tags
    - "eks"
  work_pool: &common_work_pool
    name: "kubernetes"
    job_variables:
      image: "{{ build-image.image }}"

# the deployments section allows you to provide configuration for deploying flows
deployments:
- name: "default"
  tags: *common_tags
  schedule: null
  entrypoint: "flows/hello.py:hello"
  work_pool: *common_work_pool

- name: "arthur"
  tags: *common_tags
  schedule: null
  entrypoint: "flows/hello.py:hello"
  parameters:
    name: "Arthur"
  work_pool: *common_work_pool
```

We define two deployments of the `hello` flow: `default` and `arthur`. Note that by specifying `dockerfile: auto`, Prefect will automatically create a dockerfile that installs any `requirements.txt` and copies over the current directory. You can pass a custom Dockerfile instead with `dockerfile: Dockerfile` or `dockerfile: path/to/Dockerfile`. Also note that we are specifically building for the `linux/amd64` platform. This is often necessary when images are built on Macs with M series chips but run on cloud provider instances.

!!! note "Deployment specific build, push, and pull"
    The build, push, and pull steps can be overridden for each deployment. This allows for more custom behavior, such as specifying a different image for each deployment.

Let's make sure we define our requirements in a `requirements.txt` file:

```
prefect>=2.11.0
prefect-docker>=0.3.11
prefect-kubernetes>=0.2.11
```

Your directory should now look something like this:

```
flows
├── hello.py
├── prefect.yaml
└── requirements.txt
```

### Tagging images with a Git SHA

If your code is stored in a GitHub repository, it's good practice to tag your images with the Git SHA of the code used to build it. This can be done in the `prefect.yaml` file with a few minor modifications. Let's use the `run_shell_script` command to grab the SHA and pass it to the `tag` parameter of `build_docker_image`:

```yaml hl_lines="2-5 10"
build:
- prefect.deployments.steps.run_shell_script:
    id: get-commit-hash
    script: git rev-parse --short HEAD
    stream_output: false
- prefect_docker.deployments.steps.build_docker_image:
    id: build-image
    requires: prefect-docker>=0.3.1
    image_name: "{{ $PREFECT_IMAGE_NAME }}"
    tag: "{{ get-commit-hash.stdout }}"
    dockerfile: auto
    platform: "linux/amd64"
```

Let's also set the SHA as a tag for easy identification in the UI:

```yaml hl_lines="4"
definitions:
  tags: &common_tags
    - "eks"
    - "{{ get-commit-hash.stdout }}"
  work_pool: &common_work_pool
    name: "kubernetes"
    job_variables:
      image: "{{ build-image.image }}"
```

## Deploy the flows

Now we're ready to deploy our flows which will build our images. The image name determines which registry it will end up in. We have configured our `prefect.yaml` file to get the image name from the `PREFECT_IMAGE_NAME` environment variable, so let's set that first:

=== "AWS"

    ```bash
    export PREFECT_IMAGE_NAME=<AWS_ACCOUNT_ID>.dkr.ecr.<REGION>.amazonaws.com/<IMAGE-NAME>
    ```

<!-- === "GCP"
    TODO

=== "Azure"
    TODO -->

Deploy all the flows with `prefect deploy --all` or deploy them individually by name: `prefect deploy -n hello/default` or `prefect deploy -n hello/arthur`

## Run the flows

Once successfully deployed we can run the flows from the UI or the CLI:

```bash
prefect deployment run hello/default
prefect deployment run hello/arthur
```

Congratulations! You just ran two flows in Kubernetes. Now head over to the UI to check their status.
