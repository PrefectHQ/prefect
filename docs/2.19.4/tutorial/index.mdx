Prefect orchestrates workflows — it simplifies the creation, scheduling, and monitoring of complex data pipelines.
You define workflows as Python code and Prefect handles the rest.

Prefect also provides error handling, retry mechanisms, and a user-friendly dashboard for monitoring.
It's the easiest way to transform any Python function into a unit of work that can be observed and orchestrated.

This tutorial provides a guided walk-through of Prefect's core concepts and instructions on how to use them.

You will:

1. [Create a flow](/2.19.4/tutorial/flows/)
2. [Add tasks to it](/2.19.4/tutorial/tasks/)
3. [Deploy and run the flow locally](/2.19.4/tutorial/deployments/)
4. [Create a work pool and run the flow on remote infrastructure](/2.19.4/tutorial/work-pools/)

These four topics will get most users to their first production deployment.

Advanced users that need more governance and control of their workflow infrastructure can go one step further by:

5.[Using a worker-based deployment](/2.19.4/tutorial/workers/)

If you're looking for examples of more advanced operations (such as [deploying on Kubernetes](/2.19.4/guides/deployment/kubernetes/)), check out Prefect's [guides](/2.19.4/guides/).

Compared to the [Quickstart](/2.19.4/getting-started/quickstart/), this tutorial is a more in-depth guide to Prefect's functionality.
You will also see how to customize the Docker image where your flow runs and learn how to run flows on your own infrastructure.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have Python installed in a virtual environment.
Then install Prefect:

<div class="terminal">
```bash
pip install -U prefect
```
</div>

See the [install guide](/2.19.4/getting-started/installation/) for more detailed instructions.

To get the most out of Prefect, you need to connect to a forever-free [Prefect Cloud](https://app.prefect.cloud) account.

1. Create a new account or sign in at [https://app.prefect.cloud/](https://app.prefect.cloud/).
1. Use the `prefect cloud login` CLI command to [authenticate to Prefect Cloud](/2.19.4/cloud/users/api-keys/) from your environment.

<div class="terminal">
```bash
prefect cloud login
```
</div>

Choose **Log in with a web browser** and click the **Authorize** button in the browser window that opens.

If you have any issues with browser-based authentication, see the [Prefect Cloud docs](/2.19.4/cloud/users/api-keys/) to learn how to authenticate with a manually created API key.

As an alternative to using Prefect Cloud, you can self-host a [Prefect server instance](/2.19.4/host/).
If you choose this option, run `prefect server start` to start a local Prefect server instance.
