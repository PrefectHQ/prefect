Prefect tasks are a fundamental component of Prefect's workflow orchestration framework. While flows provide a high-level structure for organizing and executing your code, tasks add another atomic component that can be orchestrated and observed within the context of a flow. 

!!! note "Check out the [tasks concept doc](/docs/concepts/tasks.md) for more features and detailed information"

!!! warning Task Gotchas 
    Tasks cannot be called from other tasks directly, but they enable concurrency, allowing you to execute multiple tasks concurrently. This concurrency can greatly enhance the efficiency and performance of your workflows.

To demonstrate the usage of tasks, let's modify our existing flow by adding some tasks. 

```python
import httpx
from prefect import flow, task

@flow(log_prints = True)
def get_repo_info():
    url = 'https://api.github.com/repos/PrefectHQ/prefect'
    api_response = httpx.get(url)
    if api_response.status_code == 200:
        repo_info = api_response.json()
        stars = repo_info['stargazers_count']
        forks = repo_info['forks_count']
        contributors_url = repo_info['contributors_url']
        contributors = get_contributors(contributors_url)
        average_commits = calculate_average_commits(contributors)
        print(f"PrefectHQ/prefect repository statistics ü§ì:")
        print(f"Stars üå† : {stars}")
        print(f"Forks üç¥ : {forks}")
        print(f"Average commits per contributor üíå : {average_commits:.2f}")
    else:
        raise Exception('Failed to fetch repository information.')
@task()
def get_contributors(url):
    response = httpx.get(url)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        contributors = response.json()
        return len(contributors)
    else:
        raise Exception('Failed to fetch contributors.')
@task()
def calculate_average_commits(contributors):
    commits_url = f'https://api.github.com/repos/PrefectHQ/prefect/stats/contributors'
    response = httpx.get(commits_url)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        commit_data = response.json()
        total_commits = sum(c['total'] for c in commit_data)
        average_commits = total_commits / contributors
        return average_commits
    else:
        raise Exception('Failed to fetch commit information.')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    get_repo_info()
```

Now run your flow in the terminal

Locally we'll see something like this: 
<div class="terminal">
```bash
13:04:19.212 | INFO    | prefect.engine - Created flow run 'invisible-millipede' for flow 'get-repo-info'

```
</div>

If we click the link in our terminal and follow it to Prefect Cloud, we'll see something like this:

![Tasks provide greater visibility as well as concurrency](/img/tutorial/cloud-flow-run.png)

By encapsulating a specific unit of work within a `task`, you can define its inputs, outputs, and behavior. This modular approach allows for easier management and composition of complex workflows.

For example, you can create a `task` that makes a network call to an external API and retrieves data. This `task` can then be orchestrated alongside other tasks within the flow, providing a clear structure to our workflow.

Flows and tasks share some common features. Both have metadata attributes such as name, description (which can be in full markdown format), and tags. They also support type-checked parameters, allowing you to define the expected data types of inputs and outputs. Additionally, both flows and tasks provide functionality for retries, timeouts, and other hooks to handle failure and completion events. This overlap in functionality ensures consistency and flexibility in managing your workflows.

Some examples of task features include:

- Concurrency
- Caching
- Parallelism
- Concurrency Limits
- Tagging
- Retries
- Advanced dependency management

!!! warning Task Usage

    By separating network calls between tasks, Prefect features like caching or retries are most useful.

!!! note Complex workflows

    What if I have more complex workflows and want more information? 
    Subflows are a great way to organize your workflows and offer more visibility within the UI. 

### Subflow

Not only can you call task functions within a flow, but you can also call other flow functions! Child flows are called¬†[subflows](https://docs.prefect.io/concepts/flows/#composing-flows)¬†and allow you to efficiently manage, track, and version common multi-task logic.

We can replace the `@task` decorator with a `@flow` decorator on `calculate_average_commits`, which allows for more visibility on this flow pattern. 
```python
import httpx
from prefect import flow

@flow(log_prints = True)
def get_repo_info():
    url = 'https://api.github.com/repos/PrefectHQ/prefect'
    api_response = httpx.get(url)
    if api_response.status_code == 200:
        repo_info = api_response.json()
        stars = repo_info['stargazers_count']
        forks = repo_info['forks_count']
        contributors_url = repo_info['contributors_url']
        contributors = get_contributors(contributors_url)
        average_commits = calculate_average_commits(contributors)
        print(f"PrefectHQ/prefect repository statistics ü§ì:")
        print(f"Stars üå† : {stars}")
        print(f"Forks üç¥ : {forks}")
        print(f"Average commits per contributor üíå : {average_commits:.2f}")
    else:
        raise Exception('Failed to fetch repository information.')
@task()
def get_contributors(url):
    response = httpx.get(url)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        contributors = response.json()
        return len(contributors)
    else:
        raise Exception('Failed to fetch contributors.')
@flow()
def calculate_average_commits(contributors):
    commits_url = f'https://api.github.com/repos/PrefectHQ/prefect/stats/contributors'
    response = httpx.get(commits_url)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        commit_data = response.json()
        total_commits = sum(c['total'] for c in commit_data)
        average_commits = total_commits / contributors
        return average_commits
    else:
        raise Exception('Failed to fetch commit information.')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    get_repo_info()
```

Whenever we run the parent flow is run, a new run will be generated for related functions within that as well. Not only is this run tracked as a subflow run of the main flow, but you can also inspect it independently in the UI!

You will be able to visualize this subflow pattern within your logging in the CLI. Note that a new subflow is generated for `calculate-average-commits`
<div class="terminal">

With subflows, you easily have coupled workflows in just a few lines!
