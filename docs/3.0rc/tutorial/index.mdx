Learn the basics of creating and running Prefect flows and tasks.

Prefect orchestrates workflows through the creation, scheduling, and monitoring of complex data pipelines.
You can transform any Python function into a unit of work that can be observed and orchestrated. You define workflows as Python code and Prefect handles the rest.

Prefect also provides error handling, retry mechanisms, and a user-friendly dashboard for monitoring.

This tutorial provides a guided walk-through of Prefect's core concepts, including how to:

1. [Create a flow](/3.0rc/tutorial/flows/)
2. [Add tasks to it](/3.0rc/tutorial/tasks/)
3. [Deploy and run the flow locally](/3.0rc/tutorial/deployments/)
4. [Create a work pool and run the flow on remote infrastructure](/3.0rc/tutorial/work-pools/)
5. [Create a worker-based deployment](/3.0rc/tutorial/workers/) (For advanced users who need more governance.)

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have Python installed in a virtual environment.
Then install Prefect:

```bash
pip install -U prefect
```

See the [install guide](/3.0rc/getting-started/installation/) for more detailed instructions.

To get the most out of Prefect, you need to connect to a forever-free [Prefect Cloud](https://app.prefect.cloud) account.

1. Create a new account or sign in at [https://app.prefect.cloud/](https://app.prefect.cloud/).
1. Use the `prefect cloud login` CLI command to [authenticate to Prefect Cloud](/3.0rc/cloud/users/api-keys/) from your environment.

```bash
prefect cloud login
```

Choose **Log in with a web browser** and click **Authorize**.

If you have any issues with browser-based authentication, see the [Prefect Cloud docs](/3.0rc/cloud/users/api-keys/) to learn how to authenticate with a manually created API key.

As an alternative to using Prefect Cloud, you can self-host a [Prefect server instance](/3.0rc/guides/host/).
If you choose this option, run `prefect server start` to start a local Prefect server instance.
