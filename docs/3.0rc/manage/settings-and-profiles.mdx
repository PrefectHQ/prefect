title: Configure settings and profiles
description: Prefect settings let you customize your workflow environment, including your Cloud profile and locally hosted Server
---

Many of Prefect's features - especially interactions with the API - require configuration.
Configuration can be set through two mechanisms:
- **environment variables**: Prefect settings are always prefixed with `PREFECT_`. Using environment variables
is most useful when configuring the runtime environment of a workflow or when updating settings temporarily
for a single session.
- **Prefect profiles**: Prefect profiles store your preferred settings locally, and allow you to switch
between common groups of configuration; for example, when switching between a locally hosted server and a
Prefect Cloud instance.

To view all available settings and their active values from the command line, run:

```bash
prefect config view --show-defaults
```

These settings are type-validated and [documented](https://prefect-python-sdk-docs.netlify.app/prefect/settings/).

## Manage profiles

Prefect profiles are persisted groups of settings on your local machine. 
By default these settings are stored in a [TOML](https://toml.io/en/) file located at `~/.prefect/profiles.toml`.
This location can be configured through the setting `PREFECT_PROFILES_PATH`. 
One and only one profile can be active at any time.
Initially, a `default` profile is active and contains no settings overrides.

The `prefect profile` CLI commands enable you to create, review, and manage profiles.

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `create` | Create a new profile; use the `--from` flag to copy settings from another profile. |
| `delete` | Delete the given profile. |
| `inspect` | Display settings from a given profile; defaults to active. |
| `ls` | List all profile names. |
| `rename` | Change the name of a profile. |
| `use` | Switch the active profile. |

### Configure settings

The `prefect config` CLI commands enable you to manage the settings within the currently active profile.

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| set | Change the value for a setting. |
| unset | Restore the default value for a setting. |
| view | Display the current settings. |

For example, the following CLI commands set configuration in the `default` profile and then create a new
profile with new settings:

```bash
prefect profile use default
prefect config set PREFECT_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:4200/api

prefect profile create new-profile --from default
prefect profile use new-profile
prefect config set PREFECT_RESULTS_PERSIST_BY_DEFAULT=true PREFECT_LOGGING_LEVEL="ERROR"

prefect profile inspect
prefect config unset PREFECT_LOGGING_LEVEL="ERROR" -y
```

### Use Environment variables

All settings have keys that match the name of the environment variable that can be used to override them.

For example, we can temporarily set the logging level through an environment variable so that it 
only lasts for the duration of the command:

```bash
PREFECT_LOGGING_LEVEL="CRITICAL" prefect config view --show-sources
```

<Tip>
**Environment variables always take precedence**

Environment variables always take precedence over values stored within a profile.
This allows you to configure certain runtime behavior for your workflows by setting the appropriate
environment variable on the job or process executing the workflow.

## Commonly configured settings

This section describes some commonly configured settings. 

### Prefect Cloud

- **`PREFECT_API_KEY`**: the `PREFECT_API_KEY` value specifies the 
[API key](/3.0rc/manage/cloud/manage-users/api-keys/) used to authenticate with Prefect Cloud.
- **`PREFECT_API_URL`**: the `PREFECT_API_URL` value specifies the API endpoint of your 
Prefect Cloud workspace or a self-hosted Prefect server instance.

<Tip>
**Use `prefect cloud login` to set these values for Prefect Cloud**

To set the `PREFECT_API_URL` and `PREFECT_API_KEY` for your active profile, run `prefect cloud login`. 
Read more about [managing API keys](/3.0rc/manage/cloud/manage-users/api-keys/). 
</Tip>

### Prefect Server

- **`PREFECT_HOME`**: the `PREFECT_HOME` value specifies the local Prefect directory for configuration files,
profiles, and the location of the default Prefect SQLite database.
- **`PREFECT_API_DATABASE_CONNECTION_URL`**: the database connection URL for a locally hosted Prefect instance.
Must be provided in a SQLAlchemy-compatible format. Prefect currently supports SQLite and Postgres. 

## Security settings

### Host the UI behind a reverse proxy

When using a reverse proxy (such as [Nginx](https://nginx.org) or [Traefik](https://traefik.io)) to proxy traffic to a 
 hosted Prefect UI instance, you must also configure the Prefect server instance to connect to the API. 
The PREFECT_UI_API_URL should be set to the external proxy URL.

For example, if your external URL is `https://prefect-server.example.com` then set 
`PREFECT_UI_API_URL=https://prefect-server.example.com/api` for the Prefect server process.
You can also set `PREFECT_API_URL` to the API URL. 

This setting is a fallback if `PREFECT_UI_API_URL` is not set.

### CSRF protection settings

If using a local Prefect server instance, you can configure CSRF protection settings.

- **`PREFECT_SERVER_CSRF_PROTECTION_ENABLED`**: activates CSRF protection on the server, 
requiring valid CSRF tokens for applicable requests. Recommended for production to prevent CSRF attacks. 
Defaults to `False`.
- **`PREFECT_SERVER_CSRF_TOKEN_EXPIRATION`**: sets the expiration duration for server-issued CSRF tokens, 
influencing how often tokens need to be refreshed. The default is 1 hour.
- **`PREFECT_CLIENT_CSRF_SUPPORT_ENABLED`**: enables or disables CSRF token handling in the Prefect client. 
When enabled, the client manages CSRF tokens for state-changing API requests. Defaults to `True`.

By default clients expect that CSRF protection is enabled on the server. If you are running a server without CSRF protection, 
you can disable CSRF support in the client.
