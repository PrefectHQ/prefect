title: Manage account roles
description: Configure user workspace roles in Prefect Cloud.
---

Prefect Cloud's [Pro and Enterprise tiers](https://www.prefect.io/pricing) allow you to set team member 
access to the appropriate level within specific workspaces.

Role-based access controls (RBAC) enable you to assign users granular permissions to perform certain activities.

Enterprise account Admins can create custom roles for users to give users access to capabilities 
beyond the scope of Prefect’s built-in workspace roles.

## Built-in roles

Roles give users abilities at either the account level or at the individual workspace level.

- An _account-level role_ defines a user's default permissions within an account.
- A _workspace-level role_ defines a user's permissions within a specific workspace.

The following sections outline the abilities of the built-in, Prefect-defined access controls and workspace roles.

### Account-level roles

The following built-in roles have permissions across an account in Prefect Cloud.

| Role   | Abilities                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

## Custom workspace roles

The built-in roles serve the needs of most users, but custom roles give users access to 
specific permissions within a workspace.

Custom roles can inherit permissions from a built-in role.
This enables tweaks to the role to meet your team’s needs, while ensuring users still benefit 
from Prefect’s default workspace role permission curation as new capabilities becomes available.

You can create custom workspace roles independently of Prefect’s built-in roles. This option gives 
workspace admins full control of user access to workspace capabilities. However, for non-inherited custom roles, 
the workspace admin takes on the responsibility for monitoring and setting permissions for new capabilities as it is released.

See [Role permissions](#workspace-role-permissions) for details of permissions you may set for custom roles.

After you create a new role, it becomes available in the account **Members** page and the **Workspace Sharing** 
page for you to apply to users.

### Inherited roles

You can configure a custom role as an **Inherited Role**. Using an inherited role allows you to create a 
custom role from a set of initial permissions associated with a built-in Prefect role. 
You can add additional permissions to the custom role. Permissions included in the inherited role cannot be removed.

Custom roles created from an inherited role follow Prefect's default workspace role permission curation as 
new capabilities becomes available.

To configure an inherited role alongside a custom role, select **Inherit permission from a default role**, then select the role from which the new role should inherit permissions.

## Workspace role permissions

The following permissions are available for custom roles.
