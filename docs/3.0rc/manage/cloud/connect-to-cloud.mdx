title: Connect to Prefect Cloud
description: Configure a local execution environment to access Prefect Cloud.
---

To create flow runs in a local or remote execution environment, first connect with Prefect Cloud or a 
Prefect server as the backend API server. 

This involves: 

- Configuring the execution environment with the location of the API.
- Authenticating with the API, either by logging in or providing a valid API key (Prefect Cloud only).

## Log into Prefect Cloud from a terminal

Configure a local execution environment to use Prefect Cloud as the API server for flow runs. 
You will "log in" to Prefect Cloud from a local environment where you want to run a flow.

### Steps 

1. Open a new terminal session.
2. [Install Prefect](/3.0rc/get-started/install/) in the environment where you want to execute flow runs.

```bash
pip install -U prefect
```

3. Use the `prefect cloud login` Prefect CLI command to log into Prefect Cloud from your environment.

```bash
prefect cloud login
```

The `prefect cloud login` command provides an interactive login experience. 

```bash
prefect cloud login
```

```bash
? How would you like to authenticate? [Use arrows to move; enter to select]
> Log in with a web browser
    Paste an API key
Paste your authentication key:
? Which workspace would you like to use? [Use arrows to move; enter to select]
> prefect/terry-prefect-workspace
    g-gadflow/g-workspace
Authenticated with Prefect Cloud! Using workspace 'prefect/terry-prefect-workspace'.
```

You can authenticate by manually pasting an [API key](/3.0rc/manage/cloud/manage-users/api-keys/) or through a browser-based approval that auto-generates an API key with a 30-day expiration.

### Change workspaces

To change which workspace to sync with, use the `prefect cloud workspace set` 
Prefect CLI command while logged in, passing the account handle and workspace name:

```bash
prefect cloud workspace set --workspace "prefect/my-workspace"
```

If you don't provide a workspace, you will need to select one.

**Workspace Settings** also shows you the `prefect cloud workspace set` Prefect CLI 
command to sync a local execution environment with a given workspace.

You may also use the `prefect cloud login` command with the `--workspace` or `-w` option to set the current workspace.

```bash
prefect cloud login --workspace "prefect/my-workspace"
```

## Manually configure Prefect API settings

You can manually configure the `PREFECT_API_URL` setting to specify the Prefect Cloud API.

For Prefect Cloud, configure the `PREFECT_API_URL` and `PREFECT_API_KEY` settings to authenticate 
with Prefect Cloud by using an account ID, workspace ID, and API key.

```bash
prefect config set PREFECT_API_URL="https://api.prefect.cloud/api/accounts/[ACCOUNT-ID]/workspaces/[WORKSPACE-ID]"
prefect config set PREFECT_API_KEY="[API-KEY]"
```

When you're in a Prefect Cloud workspace, you can copy the `PREFECT_API_URL` value directly from the page URL.

This example configures `PREFECT_API_URL` and `PREFECT_API_KEY` in the default profile. 
You can use `prefect profile` CLI commands to create settings profiles for different configurations. 
For example, you can configure a "cloud" profile to use the Prefect Cloud API URL and API key; 
and another "local" profile for local development using a local Prefect API server started with `prefect server start`. 
See [Settings](/3.0rc/manage/settings-and-profiles/) for details.

<Note>
**Environment variables**

You can set `PREFECT_API_URL` and `PREFECT_API_KEY` just like any other environment variable. 
See [Overriding defaults with environment variables](/3.0rc/manage/settings-and-profiles/) 
for more information.
</Note>

## Install requirements in execution environments

In local and remote execution environments, such as VMs and containers, ensure that you've installed any flow 
requirements or dependencies before creating a flow run.
