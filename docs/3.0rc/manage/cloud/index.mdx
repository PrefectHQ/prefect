Prefect Cloud is a hosted workflow application platform with all the capabilities of the open source Prefect server plus additional features.

The pages that follow provide detailed information about the features and capabilities of Prefect Cloud:

- [Manage workspaces](/3.0rc/manage/cloud/workspaces/) shows how to use isolated environments for organizing activity.

The **Manage accounts** subsection covers aspects of Prefect Cloud accounts:
- [Manage user accounts](/3.0rc/manage/cloud/manage-users/) explains how to use Prefect Cloud's personal accounts.

- [Manage teams](3.0rc/manage/cloud/manage-users/manage-teams/) demonstrates how groups of users can be managed together. <span class="badge enterprise"></span>
- [Manage account roles](/3.0rc/manage/cloud/manage-users/manage-roles/) shows how to use role-based access controls (RBAC): granular permissions to perform certain activities within an account or a workspace. Enterprise plans allow for custom roles with specific permissions. 
- [Manage API keys](/3.0rc/manage/cloud/manage-users/api-keys/) explains how to grant access to Prefect Cloud from a local execution environment.

Pages relevant to Prefect Cloud found elsewhere in the documentation include:

- [Push work pools](/3.0rc/deploy/infrastructure-examples/serverless/) allow you to run flows on your serverless infrastructure without running a worker.
- [Managed work pools](/3.0rc/deploy/infrastructure-examples/managed/) allow you to run flows on Prefect's infrastructure without running a worker.
- [Webhooks](/3.0rc/automate/events/webhook-triggers/) .

Error summaries (enabled by Marvin AI) distill the error logs of `Failed` and `Crashed` flow runs into actionable information. To enable this feature visit the **Settings** page for your account.

The [Prefect Cloud REST API](/3.0rc/api-ref/rest-api/) is used to send and receive data for orchestration and monitoring between Prefect clients and Prefect Cloud.
Prefect interactive Cloud REST API documentation is available at <a href="https://app.prefect.cloud/api/docs" target="_blank">https://app.prefect.cloud/api/docs</a>.
