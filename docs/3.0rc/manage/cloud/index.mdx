title: Prefect Cloud Overview
description: Observe and orchestrate your workflow applications with the Prefect Cloud platform.
---

Prefect Cloud is a hosted workflow application platform with all the capabilities of an open source Prefect server instance plus additional features, such as:

- [User accounts](#user-accounts)&mdash;personal accounts for working in Prefect Cloud.
- [Workspaces](#workspaces/)&mdash;isolated environments to organize your flows, deployments, and flow runs.
- [Service accounts](/3.0rc/manage/cloud/manage-users/service-accounts/)&mdash;configure API access for running workers or executing flow runs on remote infrastructure.
- [Custom role-based access controls (RBAC)](/3.0rc/manage/cloud/manage-users/manage-roles/)&mdash;assign users granular permissions to perform certain activities within an account or a workspace.
- [Single Sign-on (SSO)](/3.0rc/manage/cloud/manage-users/configure-sso/)&mdash;authentication using your identity provider.
- [Audit Logs](/3.0rc/manage/cloud/manage-users/audit-logs/)&mdash;a record of user activities to monitor security and compliance.
- Collaboration&mdash;invite other people to your account.
- Error summaries&mdash;(enabled by Marvin AI) distill the error logs of `Failed` and `Crashed` flow runs into actionable information.
- [Push work pools](/3.0rc/deploy/infrastructure-examples/serverless/)&mdash;run flows on your serverless infrastructure without running a worker.

## User accounts

When you sign up for Prefect Cloud, an account and a user profile are automatically provisioned for you.

Your profile is the place where you'll manage settings related to yourself as a user, including:

- Profile, including profile handle and image
- API keys
- Preferences, including timezone and color mode

As an account Admin, you will also have access to account settings from the Account Settings page, such as:

- Members
- Workspaces
- Roles

As an account Admin you can create a [workspace](#workspaces) and invite other individuals to your workspace.

Upgrading from a Prefect Cloud Free tier plan to a Pro or Enterprise tier plan enables additional capabilities for adding workspaces, managing teams, and running higher volume workloads.

Workspace Admins for Pro tier plans have the ability to set [role-based access controls (RBAC)](#roles-and-custom-permissions), view [Audit Logs](#audit-log), and configure [service accounts](#service-accounts).

Enterprise plans have [object-level access control lists](/3.0rc/manage/cloud/manage-users/object-access-control-lists/), [custom roles](/3.0rc/manage/cloud/manage-users/manage-roles/), [teams](/3.0rc/manage/cloud/manage-users/manage-teams/), and [single sign-on (SSO)](#single-sign-on-(sso) with [Directory Sync/SCIM provisioning](/3.0rc/manage/cloud/manage-users/configure-sso/#scim-provisioning).

## Workspaces

A workspace is an isolated environment within Prefect Cloud for all Prefect activity, including:
- [Flow runs](/3.0rc/develop/write-flows/) and task runs executed in an environment that is [syncing with the workspace](/3.0rc/manage/cloud/workspaces/)
- [Flows](/3.0rc/develop/write-flows/) associated with flow runs and deployments observed by the Prefect Cloud API
- [Deployments](/3.0rc/deploy/infrastructure-examples/docker/)
- [Work pools](/3.0rc/deploy/infrastructure-concepts/work-pools/)
- [Blocks](/3.0rc/develop/blocks/)
- [Events](/3.0rc/automate/events/)
- [Automations](/3.0rc/automate/events/automations-triggers/)
- [Incidents](/3.0rc/automate/events/events/)

See the [Workspaces](/3.0rc/manage/cloud/workspaces/) page for more information about configuring and using workspaces.

## Incidents <span class="badge pro"></span> <span class="badge enterprise"></span>

Prefect Cloud's [incidents](/3.0rc/automate/events/events/) help teams identify, rectify, and document issues in mission-critical workflows.
Incidents are formal declarations of disruptions to a workspace.
With [automations](/3.0rc/automate/events/events/#incident-automations)), activity in that workspace can be paused when an incident is created and resumed when it is resolved.

## Error summaries

Prefect Cloud error summaries, enabled by Marvin AI, distill the error logs of `Failed` and `Crashed` flow runs into actionable information.
To enable this feature and others powered by Marvin AI, visit the **Settings** page for your account.

## Service accounts <span class="badge pro"></span> <span class="badge enterprise"></span>

Service accounts enable you to create Prefect Cloud API keys that are not associated with a user account.
Service accounts are typically used to configure API access for running workers or executing flow runs on remote infrastructure.
See the [service accounts](/3.0rc/manage/cloud/manage-users/service-accounts/) documentation for more information about creating and managing service accounts.

## Roles and custom permissions <span class="badge pro"> </span><span class="badge enterprise"></span>

Role-based access controls (RBAC) enable you to assign users a role with permissions to perform certain activities within an account or a workspace.
See the [role-based access controls (RBAC)](/3.0rc/manage/cloud/manage-users/manage-roles/) documentation for more information about managing user roles in a Prefect Cloud account.

## Single Sign-on (SSO) <span class="badge pro"></span> <span class="badge enterprise"></span>

Prefect Cloud's [Pro and Enterprise plans](https://www.prefect.io/pricing) offer [single sign-on (SSO)](/3.0rc/manage/cloud/manage-users/configure-sso/) authentication integration with your teamâ€™s identity provider.
SSO integration can bet set up with identity providers that support OIDC and SAML.
Directory Sync and SCIM provisioning is also available with Enterprise plans.

## Audit log <span class="badge pro"></span> <span class="badge enterprise"></span>

Prefect Cloud's [Pro and Enterprise plans](https://www.prefect.io/pricing) offer [Audit Logs](/3.0rc/manage/cloud/manage-users/audit-logs/) for compliance and security.
Audit logs provide a chronological record of activities performed by users in an account.

## Prefect Cloud REST API

The [Prefect REST API](/3.0rc/api-ref/rest-api/) is used for communicating data from Prefect clients to Prefect Cloud or a local Prefect server for orchestration and monitoring.
This API is mainly consumed by Prefect clients like the Prefect Python Client or the Prefect UI.
