Prefect Cloud is a hosted workflow application platform with all the capabilities of an open source Prefect server instance plus additional features, such as:

- [Workspaces](/3.0rc/manage/cloud/workspaces/) are isolated environments for organizing all Prefect activity including flows, tasks, and automations.
- [User accounts](/3.0rc/manage/cloud/manage-users/) are personal accounts for working in Prefect Cloud.
- [Service accounts](/3.0rc/manage/cloud/manage-users/service-accounts/) <span class="badge pro"></span> <span class="badge enterprise"></span> let you configure API access for running workers or executing flow runs on remote infrastructure through API keys that are not associated with a user account.
- Teams
- [Role-based access controls (RBAC)](/3.0rc/manage/cloud/manage-users/manage-roles/) assign users granular permissions to perform certain activities within an account or a workspace. Custom roles can be created with specific permissions in Pro and Enterprise plans.

Prefect Cloud's [Pro and Enterprise plans](https://www.prefect.io/pricing) offer [Audit Logs](/3.0rc/manage/cloud/manage-users/audit-logs/) for compliance and security.
Audit logs provide a chronological record of activities performed by users in an account.

## Prefect Cloud REST API

The [Prefect REST API](/3.0rc/api-ref/rest-api/) is used for communicating data from Prefect clients to Prefect Cloud or a local Prefect server for orchestration and monitoring.
This API is mainly consumed by Prefect clients like the Prefect Python Client or the Prefect UI.
