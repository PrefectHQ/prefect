Prefect Cloud is a hosted workflow application platform with all the capabilities of an open source Prefect server instance plus additional features, such as:

- [Workspaces](/3.0rc/manage/cloud/workspaces/) are isolated environments for organizing all Prefect activity.
- [User accounts](/3.0rc/manage/cloud/manage-users/) are personal accounts for working in Prefect Cloud.
- [Service accounts](/3.0rc/manage/cloud/manage-users/service-accounts/) let you configure API access for running workers or executing flow runs on remote infrastructure through API keys that are not associated with a user account. <span class="badge pro"></span> <span class="badge enterprise"></span>

- [Teams](3.0rc/manage/cloud/manage-users/manage-teams/) are groups of users that can be managed together. <span class="badge enterprise"></span>
- [Role-based access controls (RBAC)](/3.0rc/manage/cloud/manage-users/manage-roles/) are granular permissions to perform certain activities within an account or a workspace. Enterprise plans allow for custom roles with specific permissions. 
- [API keys](/3.0rc/manage/cloud/manage-users/api-keys/) grant access to Prefect Cloud from a local execution environment.
- [Single Sign-on (SSO)](/3.0rc/manage/cloud/manage-users/configure-sso/) authentication integration is supported identity providers with OIDC and SAML. Directory Sync and SCIM provisioning is also available. <span class="badge enterprise"></span>
- [Audit Logs](/3.0rc/manage/cloud/manage-users/audit-logs/) provide a record of user activities to monitor for security and compliance. <span class="badge pro"></span> <span class="badge enterprise"></span>
- [Object Access Control Lists (ACLs)](/3.0rc/manage/cloud/manage-users/object-access-control-lists/) allow administrators to restrict block and deployment access to individual actors within a workspace. <span class="badge enterprise"></span> 

- [Push work pools](/3.0rc/deploy/infrastructure-examples/serverless/) allow you to run flows on your serverless infrastructure without running a worker.
- [Managed work pools](/3.0rc/deploy/infrastructure-examples/managed/) allow you to run flows on Prefect's infrastructure without running a worker.
- [Webhooks](/3.0rc/automate/events/webhook-triggers/) .
- [Incidents](/3.0rc/automate/incidents/) are a way to track and manage issues that arise during flow runs. <span class="badge enterprise"></span> 

- Error summaries (enabled by Marvin AI) distill the error logs of `Failed` and `Crashed` flow runs into actionable information. To enable this feature visit the **Settings** page for your account.
