description: Create a deployment for a flow by calling the `serve` method.
---

The simplest way to create a [deployment](/3.0rc/deploy/serve-flows/) for your 
flow is by calling its `serve` method.
This method creates a deployment for the flow and starts a long-running process 
that monitors for work from the Prefect server.
When work is found, it is executed within its own isolated subprocess.

```python title="hello_world.py"
from prefect import flow


@flow(log_prints=True)
def hello_world(name: str = "world", goodbye: bool = False):
    print(f"Hello {name} from Prefect! 🤗")

    if goodbye:
        print(f"Goodbye {name}!")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    # creates a deployment and stays running to monitor for work instructions 
    # generated on the server

    hello_world.serve(name="my-first-deployment",
                      tags=["onboarding"],
                      parameters={"goodbye": True},
                      interval=60)
```

This interface provides the configuration for a deployment (with no 
strong infrastructure requirements), such as:

- schedules
- event triggers
- metadata such as tags and description
- default parameter values

<Tip>
**Schedules are auto-paused on shutdown**

By default, stopping the process running `flow.serve` will pause the schedule 
for the deployment (if it has one).

When running this in environments where restarts are expected use the 

`pause_on_shutdown=False` flag to prevent this behavior:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    hello_world.serve(name="my-first-deployment",
                        tags=["onboarding"],
                        parameters={"goodbye": True},
                        pause_on_shutdown=False,
                        interval=60)
```
</Tip>

### Serve multiple flows at once

Serve multiple flows with the same process using the `serve` utility along with the `to_deployment` method of flows:

```python
import time
from prefect import flow, serve


@flow
def slow_flow(sleep: int = 60):
    "Sleepy flow - sleeps the provided amount of time (in seconds)."
    time.sleep(sleep)


@flow
def fast_flow():
    "Fastest flow this side of the Mississippi."
    return


if __name__ == "__main__":
    slow_deploy = slow_flow.to_deployment(name="sleeper", interval=45)
    fast_deploy = fast_flow.to_deployment(name="fast")
    serve(slow_deploy, fast_deploy)
```

The behavior and interfaces are identical to the single flow case.

## Retrieve a flow from remote storage

You can retrieve flows from remote storage with the `flow.from_source` method.

`flow.from_source` accepts a git repository URL and an entrypoint pointing to the 
flow to load from the repository:

```python title="load_from_url.py"
from prefect import flow

my_flow = flow.from_source(
    source="https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect.git",
    entrypoint="flows/hello_world.py:hello"
)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    my_flow()
```

```bash
16:40:33.818 | INFO    | prefect.engine - Created flow run 'muscular-perch' for flow 'hello'
16:40:34.048 | INFO    | Flow run 'muscular-perch' - Hello world!
16:40:34.706 | INFO    | Flow run 'muscular-perch' - Finished in state Completed()
```

A flow entrypoint is the path to the file where the flow is located, and the name of the
flow function separated by a colon.

For additional configuration, such as specifying a private repository, 
provide a `GitRepository` object instead of URL:

```python title="load_from_storage.py"
from prefect import flow
from prefect.runner.storage import GitRepository
from prefect.blocks.system import Secret


my_flow = flow.from_source(
    source=GitRepository(
        url="https://github.com/org/private-repo.git",
        branch="dev",
        credentials={
            "access_token": Secret.load("github-access-token").get()
        }
    ),
    entrypoint="flows.py:my_flow"
)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    my_flow()
```

<Tip>
**You can serve loaded flows**

You can serve a flow loaded from remote storage with the same [`serve`](#serving-a-flow) method as a local flow:

```python title="serve_loaded_flow.py"
from prefect import flow


if __name__ == "__main__":
    flow.from_source(
        source="https://github.com/org/repo.git",
        entrypoint="flows.py:my_flow"
    ).serve(name="my-deployment")
```
</Tip>

When you serve a flow loaded from remote storage, the serving process 
periodically polls your remote storage for updates to the flow's code. 
This pattern allows you to update your flow code without restarting the serving 
process.
