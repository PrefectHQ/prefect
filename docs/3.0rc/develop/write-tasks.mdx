title: Write and run tasks
description: Learn the basics of writing tasks.
---

A Prefect task is a Python function decorated with `@task` that represents a discrete unit of work in a 
Prefect workflow. Tasks can:

- Take inputs, perform work, and return outputs
- Cache their execution across invocations
- Encapsulate workflow logic into reusable units across flows
- Receive metadata about upstream task dependencies and their state before running
- Use automatic [logging](/3.0rc/develop/logging/) to capture runtime details, tags, 
and final state
- Execute concurrently
- Be defined in the same file as the flow or imported from modules
- Be called from flows or other tasks (Prefect 2.18+)

Flows and tasks share some common features:

- They can be defined using their respective decorator, which accepts configuration settings 
(see all [task settings](/3.0rc/develop/write-tasks/#task-arguments) and 
[flow settings](/3.0rc/develop/write-flows/#flow-settings))
- They can have a name, description, and tags for organization and bookkeeping
- They provide retries, timeouts, and other hooks to handle failure and completion events

## Example task

Here's an example of what it looks like to move a request from a flow into a task:

```python repo_info.py
import httpx
from prefect import flow, task
from typing import Optional


@task
def get_url(url: str, params: Optional[dict[str, any]] = None):
    response = httpx.get(url, params=params)
    response.raise_for_status()
    return response.json()


@flow(retries=3, retry_delay_seconds=5, log_prints=True)
def get_repo_info(repo_name: str = "PrefectHQ/prefect"):
    url = f"https://api.github.com/repos/{repo_name}"
    repo_stats = get_url(url)
    print(f"{repo_name} repository statistics 🤓:")
    print(f"Stars 🌠 : {repo_stats['stargazers_count']}")
    print(f"Forks 🍴 : {repo_stats['forks_count']}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    get_repo_info()
```

Running that flow in the terminal results in something like this:

```bash
09:55:55.412 | INFO    | prefect.engine - Created flow run 'great-ammonite' for flow 'get-repo-info'
09:55:55.499 | INFO    | Flow run 'great-ammonite' - Created task run 'get_url-0' for task 'get_url'
09:55:55.500 | INFO    | Flow run 'great-ammonite' - Executing 'get_url-0' immediately...
09:55:55.825 | INFO    | Task run 'get_url-0' - Finished in state Completed()
09:55:55.827 | INFO    | Flow run 'great-ammonite' - PrefectHQ/prefect repository statistics 🤓:
09:55:55.827 | INFO    | Flow run 'great-ammonite' - Stars 🌠 : 12157
09:55:55.827 | INFO    | Flow run 'great-ammonite' - Forks 🍴 : 1251
09:55:55.849 | INFO    | Flow run 'great-ammonite' - Finished in state Completed('All states completed.')
```

This task run is tracked in the UI as well.

## Supported functions

Almost any standard Python function can be turned into a Prefect task by adding the `@task` decorator. 

<Tip>
Tasks are always executed in the main thread by default, unless a specific [task runner](/3.0rc/develop/task-runners) is used to execute them on different threads, processes, or infrastructure. This facilitates native Python debugging and profiling.
</Tip>

### Synchronous functions

The simplest Prefect task is a synchronous Python function. Here's an example of a synchronous task that prints a message:

```python
from prefect import task

@task
def print_message():
    print("Hello, I'm a task")

print_message()
```

### Asynchronous functions

Prefect also supports asynchronous Python functions. 
The resulting tasks are coroutines that can be awaited or run concurrently, following [standard async Python behavior](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html).

```python
from prefect import task
import asyncio

@task
async def print_message():
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    print("Hello, I'm an async task")

asyncio.run(print_message())
```

### Class Methods

Prefect supports snchronous and asynchronous methods as tasks, including instance methods, class methods, and static methods. For class methods and static methods, you must apply the appropriate method decorator _above_ the `@task` decorator:

```python
from prefect import task

class MyClass:

    @task
    def my_instance_method(self):
        pass

    @classmethod
    @task
    def my_class_method(cls):
        pass

    @staticmethod
    @task
    def my_static_method():
        pass

MyClass().my_instance_method()
MyClass.my_class_method()
MyClass.my_static_method()
```

### Generators

Prefect supports synchronous and asynchronous generators as tasks. The task is considered to be `Running` as long as the generator is yielding values. When the generator is exhausted, the task is considered `Completed`. Any values yielded by the generator can be consumed by other tasks, and they will automatically record the generator task as their parent. 

```python
from prefect import task

@task
def generator():
    for i in range(10):
        yield i

@task
def consumer(x):
    print(x)

for val in generator():
    consumer(val)
```

<Warning>
**Generator functions are consumed when returned from tasks**

The result of a completed task must be serializable, but generators cannot be serialized. 
Therefore, if you return a generator from a task, the generator will be fully consumed and its yielded values will be returned as a list. 
This can lead to unexpected behavior or blocking if the generator is infinite or very large.

Here is an example of proactive generator consumption:

```python
from prefect import task

def gen():
    yield from [1, 2, 3]
    print('Generator consumed!')

@task
def f():
    return gen()
    
f()  # prints 'Generator consumed!'
```

If you need to return a generator without consuming it, you can `yield` it instead of using `return`. 
Values yielded from generator tasks are not considered final results and do not face the same serialization constraints:

```python
from prefect import task

def gen():
    yield from [1, 2, 3]
    print('Generator consumed!')

@task
def f():
    yield gen()
    
generator = next(f())
list(generator) # prints 'Generator consumed!'

```
</Warning>

## Concurrency

Tasks enable concurrent execution, allowing you to execute multiple tasks asynchronously.
This concurrency can greatly enhance the efficiency and performance of your workflows.

Expand the script to calculate the average open issues per user by making more requests:

```python repo_info.py
import httpx
from datetime import timedelta
from prefect import flow, task
from prefect.tasks import task_input_hash
from typing import Optional


@task(cache_key_fn=task_input_hash, cache_expiration=timedelta(hours=1))
def get_url(url: str, params: Optional[dict[str, any]] = None):
    response = httpx.get(url, params=params)
    response.raise_for_status()
    return response.json()


def get_open_issues(repo_name: str, open_issues_count: int, per_page: int = 100):
    issues = []
    pages = range(1, -(open_issues_count // -per_page) + 1)
    for page in pages:
        issues.append(
            get_url(
                f"https://api.github.com/repos/{repo_name}/issues",
                params={"page": page, "per_page": per_page, "state": "open"},
            )
        )
    return [i for p in issues for i in p]


@flow(retries=3, retry_delay_seconds=5, log_prints=True)
def get_repo_info(repo_name: str = "PrefectHQ/prefect"):
    repo_stats = get_url(f"https://api.github.com/repos/{repo_name}")
    issues = get_open_issues(repo_name, repo_stats["open_issues_count"])
    issues_per_user = len(issues) / len(set([i["user"]["id"] for i in issues]))
    print(f"{repo_name} repository statistics 🤓:")
    print(f"Stars 🌠 : {repo_stats['stargazers_count']}")
    print(f"Forks 🍴 : {repo_stats['forks_count']}")
    print(f"Average open issues per user 💌 : {issues_per_user:.2f}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    get_repo_info()

```

Now you're fetching the data you need, but the requests happen sequentially.
Tasks expose a [`submit`](https://prefect-python-sdk-docs.netlify.app/prefect/tasks/#prefect.tasks.Task.submit) method that changes 
the execution from sequential to concurrent.
In this example, you also need to use the 
[`result`](https://prefect-python-sdk-docs.netlify.app/prefect/futures/#prefect.futures.PrefectFuture.result) 
method to unpack a list of return values:

```python 
def get_open_issues(repo_name: str, open_issues_count: int, per_page: int = 100):
    issues = []
    pages = range(1, -(open_issues_count // -per_page) + 1)
    for page in pages:
        issues.append(
            get_url.submit(
                f"https://api.github.com/repos/{repo_name}/issues",
                params={"page": page, "per_page": per_page, "state": "open"},
            )
        )
    return [i for p in issues for i in p.result()]
```

The logs show that each task is running concurrently:

```

**Call a task from a flow**

Use the `@task` decorator to designate a function as a task. Calling the task creates a new task run:

```python 
from prefect import flow, task

@task
def my_task():
    print("Hello, I'm a task")

@flow
def my_flow():
    my_task()
```

**Call a task from another task**

A task can be called from within another task:

```python
from prefect import task

@task
def my_task():
    print("Hello, I'm a task")

@task(log_prints=True)
def my_parent_task():
    my_task()
```

Tasks are uniquely identified by a task key, which is a hash composed of the task name, the fully qualified 
name of the function, and any tags. If the task does not have a name specified, the name is derived from the 
task function.

<Note>
**How big should a task be?**

Prefect encourages "small tasks." Each one should represent a single logical step of your workflow. 
This allows Prefect to better contain task failures.

There's nothing stopping you from putting all of your code in a single task. However, if any line of 
code fails, the entire task fails and must be retried from the beginning. 
Avoid this by splitting the code into multiple dependent tasks.
</Note>

## Task configuration

Tasks allow for customization through optional arguments that can be provided to the [task decorator](https://prefect-python-sdk-docs.netlify.app/prefect/tasks/#prefect.tasks.task).

| Argument              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `name`                | An optional name for the task. If not provided, the name is inferred from the function name.                                                                                                                       |
| `description`         | An optional string description for the task. If not provided, the description is pulled from the docstring for the decorated function.                                                                             |
| `tags`                | An optional set of tags associated with runs of this task. These tags are combined with any tags defined by a `prefect.tags` context at task runtime.                                                             |
| `cache_key_fn`        | An optional callable that, given the task run context and call parameters, generates a string key. If the key matches a previous completed state, that state result is restored instead of running the task again. |
| `cache_expiration`    | An optional amount of time indicating how long cached states for this task are restorable; if not provided, cached states will never expire.                                                                      |
| `retries`             | An optional number of times to retry on task run failure.                                                                                                                                                               |
| `retry_delay_seconds` | An optional number of seconds to wait before retrying the task after failure. This is only applicable if `retries` is nonzero.                                                                                          |
| `log_prints`|An optional boolean indicating whether to log print statements. |

See all possible options in the [Python SDK docs](https://prefect-python-sdk-docs.netlify.app/prefect/tasks/#prefect.tasks.task).

For example, you can provide a `name` value for the task. Here's an example of the optional `description` argument 
as well:

```python 
@task(name="hello-task", 
      description="This task says hello.")
def my_task():
    print("Hello, I'm a task")
```

You can distinguish runs of this task by providing a `task_run_name`; this setting accepts a string 
that may contain templated references to the keyword arguments of your task. The name is 
formatted using Python's standard string formatting syntax:

```python
import datetime
from prefect import flow, task

@task(name="My Example Task", 
      description="An example task for a tutorial.",
      task_run_name="hello-{name}-on-{date:%A}")
def my_task(name, date):
    pass

@flow
def my_flow():
    # creates a run with a name like "hello-marvin-on-Thursday"
    my_task(name="marvin", date=datetime.datetime.now(datetime.timezone.utc))
```

Additionally this setting accepts a function that returns a string for the task run name:

```python
import datetime
from prefect import flow, task

def generate_task_name():
    date = datetime.datetime.now(datetime.timezone.utc)
    return f"{date:%A}-is-a-lovely-day"

@task(name="My Example Task",
      description="An example task for a tutorial.",
      task_run_name=generate_task_name)
def my_task(name):
    pass

@flow
def my_flow():
    # creates a run with a name like "Thursday-is-a-lovely-day"
    my_task(name="marvin")
```

If you need access to information about the task, use the `prefect.runtime` module. For example:

```python
from prefect import flow
from prefect.runtime import flow_run, task_run

def generate_task_name():
    flow_name = flow_run.flow_name
    task_name = task_run.task_name

    parameters = task_run.parameters
    name = parameters["name"]
    limit = parameters["limit"]

    return f"{flow_name}-{task_name}-with-{name}-and-{limit}"

@task(name="my-example-task",
      description="An example task for a tutorial.",
      task_run_name=generate_task_name)
def my_task(name: str, limit: int = 100):
    pass

@flow
def my_flow(name: str):
    # creates a run with a name like "my-flow-my-example-task-with-marvin-and-100"
    my_task(name="marvin")
```

## Tags

Tags are optional string labels that enable you to identify and group tasks other than by name or flow. 
Tags are useful to:

- Filter task runs by tag in the UI and through the [Prefect REST API](/3.0rc/api-ref/rest-api/#filtering).
- Set [concurrency limits](#task-run-concurrency-limits) on task runs by tag.

You may specify tags as a keyword argument on the [task decorator](https://prefect-python-sdk-docs.netlify.app/prefect/tasks/#prefect.tasks.task).

```python 
@task(name="hello-task", tags=["test"])
def my_task():
    print("Hello, I'm a task")
```

You can also provide tags as an argument with a 
[`tags` context manager](https://prefect-python-sdk-docs.netlify.app/prefect/context/#prefect.context.tags), 
specifying tags when the task is called rather than in its definition.

```python 
from prefect import flow, task
from prefect import tags

@task
def my_task():
    print("Hello, I'm a task")

@flow
def my_flow():
    with tags("test"):
        my_task()
```

## Timeouts

Task timeouts prevent unintentional long-running tasks. When the duration of execution for a 
task exceeds the duration specified in the timeout, a timeout exception is raised and the task is  
marked as failed. In the UI, the task is visibly designated as `TimedOut`. From the perspective of the 
flow, the timed-out task is treated like any other failed task.

Specify timeout durations with the `timeout_seconds` keyword argument:

```python 
from prefect import task
import time

@task(timeout_seconds=1, log_prints=True)
def show_timeouts():
    print("I will execute")
    time.sleep(5)
    print("I will not execute")
```

## Task results

Depending on how you call tasks, they can return different types of results and optionally engage the use of 
a [task runner](/3.0rc/develop/task-runners/).

Any task can return:

- Data , such as `int`, `str`, `dict`, `list`. This is the default behavior any time you 
call `your_task()`.
- [`PrefectFuture`](https://prefect-python-sdk-docs.netlify.app/prefect/futures/#prefect.futures.PrefectFuture). This is achieved 
by calling [`your_task.submit()`](/3.0rc/develop/task-runners/#using-a-task-runner). 
A `PrefectFuture` contains both _data_ and _State_.
- Prefect [`State`](https://prefect-python-sdk-docs.netlify.app/prefect/server/schemas/states/). Anytime you call your task or flow with 
the argument `return_state=True`, it directly returns a state to build custom behavior based 
on a state change you care about, such as task or flow failing or retrying.

To run your task with a [task runner](/3.0rc/develop/task-runners/), you must call the task 
with `.submit()`.

See [state returned values](/3.0rc/develop/task-runners/#using-results-from-submitted-tasks) 
for examples.

<Tip>
**Task runners are optional**

If you just need the result from a task, call the task from your flow. For most workflows, 
the default behavior of calling a task directly and receiving a result is enough.
