## About flows

Flows are the most central Prefect object. A flow is a container for workflow logic as-code and allows users to configure how their workflows behave.
Flows are defined as Python functions, and any Python function is eligible to be a flow.

[Flows](/3.0rc/develop/write-workflows/) are like functions.
They can take inputs, perform work, and return an output.
You can turn any function into a Prefect flow by adding the `@flow` decorator.
When a function becomes a flow, its behavior changes, giving it the following advantages:

- All runs of the flow have persistent [state](/3.0rc/develop/observe-workflows/manage-states/). Transitions between states are recorded, allowing for flow execution to be observed and acted upon.
- Input arguments can be type validated as workflow parameters.
- Retries can be performed on failure.
- Timeouts can be enforced to prevent unintentional, long-running workflows.
- Metadata about [flow runs](#flow-runs), such as run time and final state, is automatically tracked.
- A flow can be elevated to a [deployment](/3.0rc/deploy/serve-workflows/), which exposes a remote API for interacting with it.

## Run your first flow

<Tip>
**Prerequisites**

This section requires that you:
- Have installed Prefect
- Connected to Prefect Cloud or a self-hosted server instance
</Tip>

The simplest way to get started with Prefect is to annotate a Python function with the¬†`@flow`¬†decorator.
The script below fetches statistics about the [main Prefect repository](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect).
(Note that [httpx](https://www.python-httpx.org/) is an HTTP client library and a dependency of Prefect.)

Let's turn this function into a Prefect flow and run the script:

```python title="repo_info.py" hl_lines="2 5"
import httpx
from prefect import flow


@flow
def get_repo_info():
    url = "https://api.github.com/repos/PrefectHQ/prefect"
    response = httpx.get(url)
    response.raise_for_status()
    repo = response.json()
    print("PrefectHQ/prefect repository statistics ü§ì:")
    print(f"Stars üå† : {repo['stargazers_count']}")
    print(f"Forks üç¥ : {repo['forks_count']}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    get_repo_info()
```

Running this file results in the following output:

```bash
12:47:42.792 | INFO | prefect.engine - Created flow run 'ludicrous-warthog' for flow 'get-repo-info'
PrefectHQ/prefect repository statistics ü§ì:
Stars üå† : 12146
Forks üç¥ : 1245
12:47:45.008 | INFO | Flow run 'ludicrous-warthog' - Finished in state Completed()
```


<Tip> "Flows can contain arbitrary Python"
    As shown above, flow definitions can contain arbitrary Python logic.</Tip>

## Parameters

As with any Python function, you can pass arguments to a flow.
The positional and keyword arguments defined on your flow function are called [parameters](/3.0rc/develop/write-workflows/#parameters).
Prefect automatically performs type conversion using any provided type hints.
Let's make the repository a string parameter with a default value:

```python hl_lines="6 7 11" title="repo_info.py"
import httpx
from prefect import flow


@flow
def get_repo_info(repo_name: str = "PrefectHQ/prefect"):
    url = f"https://api.github.com/repos/{repo_name}"
    response = httpx.get(url)
    response.raise_for_status()
    repo = response.json()
    print(f"{repo_name} repository statistics ü§ì:")
    print(f"Stars üå† : {repo['stargazers_count']}")
    print(f"Forks üç¥ : {repo['forks_count']}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    get_repo_info(repo_name="PrefectHQ/marvin")
```

You can call this flow with varying values for the `repo_name` parameter (including "bad" values):

```bash
python repo_info.py
```


Pass `repo_name="missing-org/missing-repo"` and you should see:

```bash
HTTPStatusError: Client error '404 Not Found' for url '<https://api.github.com/repos/missing-org/missing-repo>'

```


Now navigate to your Prefect dashboard and compare the displays for these two runs.

## Logging

Prefect enables you to log a variety of useful information about your flow and task runs. You can capture information about your workflows for purposes such as monitoring, troubleshooting, and auditing.
If you navigate to your dashboard and explore the runs created above, you will notice that the repository statistics are not captured in the flow run logs.  
Let's fix that by adding some [logging](/3.0rc/develop/observe-workflows/logging) to your flow:

```python hl_lines="2 11-14" title="repo_info.py"
import httpx
from prefect import flow, get_run_logger


@flow
def get_repo_info(repo_name: str = "PrefectHQ/prefect"):
    url = f"https://api.github.com/repos/{repo_name}"
    response = httpx.get(url)
    response.raise_for_status()
    repo = response.json()
    logger = get_run_logger()
    logger.info("%s repository statistics ü§ì:", repo_name)
    logger.info(f"Stars üå† : %d", repo["stargazers_count"])
    logger.info(f"Forks üç¥ : %d", repo["forks_count"])
```

Now the output looks more consistent _and_, more importantly, your statistics are stored in the Prefect backend and displayed in the UI for this flow run:
```bash
12:47:42.792 | INFO    | prefect.engine - Created flow run 'ludicrous-warthog' for flow 'get-repo-info'
12:47:43.016 | INFO    | Flow run 'ludicrous-warthog' - PrefectHQ/prefect repository statistics ü§ì:
12:47:43.016 | INFO    | Flow run 'ludicrous-warthog' - Stars üå† : 12146
12:47:43.042 | INFO    | Flow run 'ludicrous-warthog' - Forks üç¥ : 1245
12:47:45.008 | INFO    | Flow run 'ludicrous-warthog' - Finished in state Completed()
```

<Tip>
    `log_prints=True`

    You could have achieved the same outcome by using Prefect's `log_prints` keyword argument in the `flow` decorator:

    ```python

    @flow(log_prints=True)
    def get_repo_info(repo_name: str = "PrefectHQ/prefect"):
        ...

    ```
</Tip>

<Warning>
    **Logging vs. Artifacts**

    The example above is for educational purposes.
    In general, it is better to use [Prefect artifacts](/3.0rc/develop/observe-workflows/create-artifacts/) for storing metrics and output.
    Logs are best for tracking progress and debugging errors.
</Warning>


## Retries

So far the script works, but in the future unexpected errors may occur.
For example the GitHub API may be temporarily unavailable or rate limited.
[Retries](/3.0rc/develop/write-workflows/#flow-settings) help make flows more resilient.
Let's add retry functionality to the example above:

```python hl_lines="5" title="repo_info.py"
import httpx
from prefect import flow


@flow(retries=3, retry_delay_seconds=5, log_prints=True)
def get_repo_info(repo_name: str = "PrefectHQ/prefect"):
    url = f"https://api.github.com/repos/{repo_name}"
    response = httpx.get(url)
    response.raise_for_status()
    repo = response.json()
    print(f"{repo_name} repository statistics ü§ì:")
    print(f"Stars üå† : {repo['stargazers_count']}")
    print(f"Forks üç¥ : {repo['forks_count']}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    get_repo_info()
```

---

## Flow runs

A _flow run_ represents a single execution of the flow.

You can create a flow run by calling the flow manually.
For example, by running a Python script or importing the flow into an interactive session and calling it.

You can also create a flow run by:

- Using external schedulers such as `cron` to invoke a flow function
- Creating a [deployment](/3.0rc/deploy/serve-workflows/) on Prefect Cloud or a locally run Prefect server.
- Creating a flow run for the deployment via a schedule, the Prefect UI, or the Prefect API.

However you run the flow, the Prefect API monitors the flow run, capturing flow run state for observability.

When you run a flow that contains tasks or additional flows, Prefect will track the relationship of each child run to the parent flow run.

![Prefect UI](/3.0rc/img/ui/timeline-flows.png)

## Writing flows

The [`@flow`] decorator is used to designate a flow:

```python hl_lines="3"
from prefect import flow

@flow
def my_flow():
    return
```

There are no rigid rules for what code you include within a flow definition - all valid Python is acceptable.

Flows are uniquely identified by name. You can provide a `name` parameter value for the flow.
If you don't provide a name, Prefect uses the flow function name.

```python hl_lines="1"
@flow(name="My Flow")
def my_flow():
    return
```

Flows can call tasks to allow Prefect to orchestrate and track more granular units of work:

```python
from prefect import flow, task

@task
def print_hello(name):
    print(f"Hello {name}!")

@flow(name="Hello Flow")
def hello_world(name="world"):
    print_hello(name)
```

!!! tip "Flows and tasks"
    There's nothing stopping you from putting all of your code in a single flow function &mdash; Prefect will happily run it!

    However, organizing your workflow code into smaller flow and task units lets you take advantage of Prefect features like retries, more granular visibility into runtime state, the ability to determine final state regardless of individual task state, and more.

    In addition, if you put all of your workflow logic in a single flow function and any line of code fails, the entire flow will fail and must be retried from the beginning. 
    This can be avoided by breaking up the code into multiple tasks.

    You may call any number of other tasks, subflows, and even regular Python functions within your flow. 
    You can pass parameters to your flow function that will be used elsewhere in the workflow, and Prefect will report on the progress and [final state](#final-state-determination) of any invocation.

    Prefect encourages "small tasks" &mdash; each one should represent a single logical step of your workflow. 
    This allows Prefect to better contain task failures.

## Flow settings

Flows allow a great deal of configuration by passing arguments to the decorator. Flows accept the following optional settings.

| Argument                                           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| -------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `description`                                      | An optional string description for the flow. If not provided, the description will be pulled from the docstring for the decorated function.                                                                          |
| `name`                                             | An optional name for the flow. If not provided, the name will be inferred from the function.                                                                                                                         |
| `retries`                                          | An optional number of times to retry on flow run failure.                                                                                                                                                            |
| <span class="no-wrap">`retry_delay_seconds`</span> | An optional number of seconds to wait before retrying the flow after failure. This is only applicable if `retries` is nonzero.                                                                                       |
| `flow_run_name`                                    | An optional name to distinguish runs of this flow; this name can be provided as a string template with the flow's parameters as variables; this name can also be provided as a function that returns a string.       |
| `task_runner`                                      | An optional [task runner](/3.0rc/develop/write-tasks/use-task-runners/) to use for task execution within the flow when you `.submit()` tasks. If not provided and you `.submit()` tasks, the `ConcurrentTaskRunner` will be used.         |
| `timeout_seconds`                                  | An optional number of seconds indicating a maximum runtime for the flow. If the flow exceeds this runtime, it will be marked as failed. Flow execution may continue until the next task is called.                   |
| `validate_parameters`                              | Boolean indicating whether parameters passed to flows are validated by Pydantic. Default is `True`.                                                                                                                  |
| `version`                                          | An optional version string for the flow. If not provided, we will attempt to create a version string as a hash of the file containing the wrapped function. If the file cannot be located, the version will be null. |

For example, you can provide a `name` value for the flow. Here we've also used the optional `description` argument and specified a non-default task runner.

```python
from prefect import flow
from prefect.task_runners import SequentialTaskRunner

@flow(name="My Flow",
      description="My flow using SequentialTaskRunner",
      task_runner=SequentialTaskRunner())
def my_flow():
    return
```

You can also provide the description as the docstring on the flow function.

```python
@flow(name="My Flow",
      task_runner=SequentialTaskRunner())
def my_flow():
    """My flow using SequentialTaskRunner"""
    return
```

You can distinguish runs of this flow by providing a `flow_run_name`.
This setting accepts a string that can optionally contain templated references to the parameters of your flow.
The name will be formatted using Python's standard string formatting syntax as can be seen here:

```python
import datetime
from prefect import flow

@flow(flow_run_name="{name}-on-{date:%A}")
def my_flow(name: str, date: datetime.datetime):
    pass

# creates a flow run called 'marvin-on-Thursday'
my_flow(name="marvin", date=datetime.datetime.now(datetime.timezone.utc))
```

Additionally this setting also accepts a function that returns a string for the flow run name:

```python
import datetime
from prefect import flow

def generate_flow_run_name():
    date = datetime.datetime.now(datetime.timezone.utc)

    return f"{date:%A}-is-a-nice-day"

@flow(flow_run_name=generate_flow_run_name)
def my_flow(name: str):
    pass

# creates a flow run called 'Thursday-is-a-nice-day'
if __name__ == "__main__":
    my_flow(name="marvin")
```

If you need access to information about the flow, use the `prefect.runtime` module. For example:

```python
from prefect import flow
from prefect.runtime import flow_run

def generate_flow_run_name():
    flow_name = flow_run.flow_name

    parameters = flow_run.parameters
    name = parameters["name"]
    limit = parameters["limit"]

    return f"{flow_name}-with-{name}-and-{limit}"

@flow(flow_run_name=generate_flow_run_name)
def my_flow(name: str, limit: int = 100):
    pass

# creates a flow run called 'my-flow-with-marvin-and-100'
if __name__ == "__main__":
    my_flow(name="marvin")
```

Note that `validate_parameters` will check that input values conform to the annotated types on the function.
Where possible, values will be coerced into the correct type. For example, if a parameter is defined as `x: int` and "5" is passed, it will be resolved to `5`.
If set to `False`, no validation will be performed on flow parameters.

## Separating logic into tasks

The simplest workflow is just a `@flow` function that does all the work of the workflow.

```python
from prefect import flow

@flow(name="Hello Flow")
def hello_world(name="world"):
    print(f"Hello {name}!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    hello_world("Marvin")
```

When you run this flow, you'll see output like the following:

<div class="terminal">
```bash
$ python hello.py
15:11:23.594 | INFO    | prefect.engine - Created flow run 'benevolent-donkey' for flow 'hello-world'
15:11:23.594 | INFO    | Flow run 'benevolent-donkey' - Using task runner 'ConcurrentTaskRunner'
Hello Marvin!
15:11:24.447 | INFO    | Flow run 'benevolent-donkey' - Finished in state Completed()
```
</div>

A better practice is to create `@task` functions that do the specific work of your flow, and use your `@flow` function as the conductor that orchestrates the flow of your application:

```python
from prefect import flow, task

@task(name="Print Hello")
def print_hello(name):
    msg = f"Hello {name}!"
    print(msg)
    return msg

@flow(name="Hello Flow")
def hello_world(name="world"):
    message = print_hello(name)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    hello_world("Marvin")
```

When you run this flow, you'll see the following output, which illustrates how the work is encapsulated in a task run.

<div class="terminal">
```bash
$ python hello.py
15:15:58.673 | INFO    | prefect.engine - Created flow run 'loose-wolverine' for flow 'Hello Flow'
15:15:58.674 | INFO    | Flow run 'loose-wolverine' - Using task runner 'ConcurrentTaskRunner'
15:15:58.973 | INFO    | Flow run 'loose-wolverine' - Created task run 'Print Hello-84f0fe0e-0' for task 'Print Hello'
Hello Marvin!
15:15:59.037 | INFO    | Task run 'Print Hello-84f0fe0e-0' - Finished in state Completed()
15:15:59.568 | INFO    | Flow run 'loose-wolverine' - Finished in state Completed('All states completed.')
```
</div>

## Visualizing flow structure

You can get a quick sense of the structure of your flow using the `.visualize()` method on your flow. Calling this method will attempt to produce a schematic diagram of your flow and tasks without actually running your flow code.

!!! warning "Functions and code not inside of flows or tasks will still be run when calling `.visualize()`. This may have unintended consequences. Place your code into tasks to avoid unintended execution."

!!! note "To use the `visualize()` method, Graphviz must be installed and on your PATH. Please install Graphviz from [http://www.graphviz.org/download/](http://www.graphviz.org/download/). And note: just installing the `graphviz` python package is not sufficient."

```python
from prefect import flow, task

@task(name="Print Hello")
def print_hello(name):
    msg = f"Hello {name}!"
    print(msg)
    return msg

@task(name="Print Hello Again")
def print_hello_again(name):
    msg = f"Hello {name}!"
    print(msg)
    return msg

@flow(name="Hello Flow")
def hello_world(name="world"):
    message = print_hello(name)
    message2 = print_hello_again(message)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    hello_world.visualize()
```

![A simple flow visualized with the .visualize() method](/3.0rc/img/orchestration/hello-flow-viz.png)

Prefect cannot automatically produce a schematic for dynamic workflows, such as those with loops or if/else control flow.
In this case, you can provide tasks with mock return values for use in the `visualize()` call.

```python
from prefect import flow, task
@task(viz_return_value=[4])
def get_list():
    return [1, 2, 3]

@task
def append_one(n):
    return n.append(6)

@flow
def viz_return_value_tracked():
    l = get_list()
    for num in range(3):
        l.append(5)
        append_one(l)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    viz_return_value_tracked.visualize()
```

![A flow with return values visualized with the .visualize() method](/3.0rc/img/orchestration/viz-return-value-tracked.png)

## Composing flows

A _subflow_ run is created when a flow function is called inside the execution of another flow.
The primary flow is the "parent" flow. The flow created within the parent is the "child" flow or "subflow."

Subflow runs behave like normal flow runs.
There is a full representation of the flow run in the backend as if it had been called separately.
When a subflow starts, it will create a new [task runner](/3.0rc/develop/write-tasks/use-task-runners/) for tasks within the subflow.
When the subflow completes, the task runner is shut down.

Subflows will block execution of the parent flow until completion.
However, asynchronous subflows can be run concurrently by using [AnyIO task groups](https://anyio.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tasks.html) or [asyncio.gather](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-task.html#id6).

Subflows differ from normal flows in that they will resolve any passed task futures into data.
This allows data to be passed from the parent flow to the child easily.

The relationship between a child and parent flow is tracked by creating a special task run in the parent flow.
This task run will mirror the state of the child flow run.

A task that represents a subflow will be annotated as such in its `state_details` via the presence of a `child_flow_run_id` field.
A subflow can be identified via the presence of a `parent_task_run_id` on `state_details`.

You can define multiple flows within the same file.
Whether running locally or via a [deployment](/3.0rc/deploy/serve-workflows/), you must indicate which flow is the entrypoint for a flow run.

!!! warning "Cancelling subflow runs"
    Inline subflow runs, specifically those created without `run_deployment`, cannot be cancelled without cancelling their parent flow run.
    If you may need to cancel a subflow run independent of its parent flow run, we recommend deploying it separately and starting it using the [run_deployment](/3.0rc/api-ref/prefect/deployments/deployments/#prefect.deployments.deployments.run_deployment) function.

```python
from prefect import flow, task

@task(name="Print Hello")
def print_hello(name):
    msg = f"Hello {name}!"
    print(msg)
    return msg

@flow(name="Subflow")
def my_subflow(msg):
    print(f"Subflow says: {msg}")

@flow(name="Hello Flow")
def hello_world(name="world"):
    message = print_hello(name)
    my_subflow(message)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    hello_world("Marvin")
```

You can also define flows or tasks in separate modules and import them for usage. For example, here's a simple subflow module:

```python
from prefect import flow, task

@flow(name="Subflow")
def my_subflow(msg):
    print(f"Subflow says: {msg}")
```

Here's a parent flow that imports and uses `my_subflow()` as a subflow:

```python
from prefect import flow, task
from subflow import my_subflow

@task(name="Print Hello")
def print_hello(name):
    msg = f"Hello {name}!"
    print(msg)
    return msg

@flow(name="Hello Flow")
def hello_world(name="world"):
    message = print_hello(name)
    my_subflow(message)

hello_world("Marvin")
```

Running the `hello_world()` flow (in this example from the file `hello.py`) creates a flow run like this:

<div class="terminal">
```bash
$ python hello.py
15:19:21.651 | INFO    | prefect.engine - Created flow run 'daft-cougar' for flow 'Hello Flow'
15:19:21.651 | INFO    | Flow run 'daft-cougar' - Using task runner 'ConcurrentTaskRunner'
15:19:21.945 | INFO    | Flow run 'daft-cougar' - Created task run 'Print Hello-84f0fe0e-0' for task 'Print Hello'
Hello Marvin!
15:19:22.055 | INFO    | Task run 'Print Hello-84f0fe0e-0' - Finished in state Completed()
15:19:22.107 | INFO    | Flow run 'daft-cougar' - Created subflow run 'ninja-duck' for flow 'Subflow'
Subflow says: Hello Marvin!
15:19:22.794 | INFO    | Flow run 'ninja-duck' - Finished in state Completed()
15:19:23.215 | INFO    | Flow run 'daft-cougar' - Finished in state Completed('All states completed.')
```
</div>

!!! tip "Subflows or tasks?"
    In Prefect you can call tasks _or_ subflows to do work within your workflow, including passing results from other tasks to your subflow.
    So a common question is:

    "When should I use a subflow instead of a task?"

    We recommend writing tasks that do a discrete, specific piece of work in your workflow: calling an API, performing a database operation, analyzing or transforming a data point. 
    Prefect tasks are well suited to parallel or distributed execution using distributed computation frameworks such as Dask or Ray. 
    For troubleshooting, the more granular you create your tasks, the easier it is to find and fix issues should a task fail.

    Subflows enable you to group related tasks within your workflow. 
    Here are some scenarios where you might choose to use a subflow rather than calling tasks individually:

    - Observability: Subflows, like any other flow run, have first-class observability within the Prefect UI and Prefect Cloud. You'll see subflow status in the **Flow Runs** dashboard rather than having to dig down into the tasks within a specific flow run. See [Final state determination](#final-state-determination) for some examples of leveraging task state within flows.
    - Conditional flows: If you have a group of tasks that run only under certain conditions, you can group them within a subflow and conditionally run the subflow rather than each task individually.
    - Parameters: Flows have first-class support for parameterization, making it easy to run the same group of tasks in different use cases by simply passing different parameters to the subflow in which they run.
    - Task runners: Subflows enable you to specify the task runner used for tasks within the flow. For example, if you want to optimize parallel execution of certain tasks with Dask, you can group them in a subflow that uses the Dask task runner. You can use a different task runner for each subflow.

## Parameters

Flows can be called with both positional and keyword arguments. These arguments are resolved at runtime into a dictionary of **parameters** mapping name to value.
These parameters are stored by the Prefect orchestration engine on the flow run object.

!!! warning "Prefect API requires keyword arguments"
    When creating flow runs from the Prefect API, parameter names must be specified when overriding defaults &mdash; they cannot be positional.

Type hints provide an easy way to enforce typing on your flow parameters via [pydantic](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/).
This means _any_ pydantic model used as a type hint within a flow will be coerced automatically into the relevant object type:

```python
from prefect import flow
from pydantic import BaseModel

class Model(BaseModel):
    a: int
    b: float
    c: str

@flow
def model_validator(model: Model):
    print(model)
```

Note that parameter values can be provided to a flow via API using a [deployment](/3.0rc/deploy/serve-workflows/).
Flow run parameters sent to the API on flow calls are coerced to a serializable form.
Type hints on your flow functions provide you a way of automatically coercing JSON provided values to their appropriate Python representation.

For example, to automatically convert something to a datetime:

```python
from prefect import flow
from datetime import datetime

@flow
def what_day_is_it(date: datetime = None):
    if date is None:
        date = datetime.now(timezone.utc)
    print(f"It was {date.strftime('%A')} on {date.isoformat()}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    what_day_is_it("2021-01-01T02:00:19.180906")
```

When you run this flow, you'll see the following output:

<div class="terminal">
```bash
It was Friday on 2021-01-01T02:00:19.180906
```
</div>

Parameters are validated before a flow is run.
If a flow call receives invalid parameters, a flow run is created in a `Failed` state.
If a flow run for a deployment receives invalid parameters, it will move from a `Pending` state to a `Failed` without entering a `Running` state.

!!! info "Flow run parameters cannot exceed `512kb` in size"

## Final state determination

!!! note "Prerequisite"
    Read the documentation about [states](/3.0rc/develop/observe-workflows/manage-states) before proceeding with this section.

The final state of the flow is determined by its return value. The following rules apply:

- If an exception is raised directly in the flow function, the flow run is marked as failed.
- If the flow does not return a value (or returns `None`), its state is determined by the states of all of the tasks and subflows within it.
  - If _any_ task run or subflow run failed, then the final flow run state is marked as `FAILED`.
  - If _any_ task run was cancelled, then the final flow run state is marked as `CANCELLED`.
- If a flow returns a manually created state, it is used as the state of the final flow run. This allows for manual determination of final state.
- If the flow run returns _any other object_, then it is marked as completed.

The following examples illustrate each of these cases:

### Raise an exception

If an exception is raised within the flow function, the flow is immediately marked as failed.

```python hl_lines="5"
from prefect import flow

@flow
def always_fails_flow():
    raise ValueError("This flow immediately fails")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    always_fails_flow()
```

Running this flow produces the following result:

<div class="terminal">
```bash
22:22:36.864 | INFO    | prefect.engine - Created flow run 'acrid-tuatara' for flow 'always-fails-flow'
22:22:36.864 | INFO    | Flow run 'acrid-tuatara' - Starting 'ConcurrentTaskRunner'; submitted tasks will be run concurrently...
22:22:37.060 | ERROR   | Flow run 'acrid-tuatara' - Encountered exception during execution:
Traceback (most recent call last):...
ValueError: This flow immediately fails
```
</div>

### Return `none`

A flow with no return statement is determined by the state of all of its task runs.

```python
from prefect import flow, task

@task
def always_fails_task():
    raise ValueError("I fail successfully")

@task
def always_succeeds_task():
    print("I'm fail safe!")
    return "success"

@flow
def always_fails_flow():
    always_fails_task.submit().result(raise_on_failure=False)
    always_succeeds_task()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    always_fails_flow()
```

Running this flow produces the following result:

<div class="terminal">
```bash

Traceback (most recent call last):
  ...
ValueError: I fail successfully
```
</div>

### Return a future

If a flow returns one or more futures, the final state is determined based on the underlying states.

```python hl_lines="15"
from prefect import flow, task

@task
def always_fails_task():
    raise ValueError("I fail successfully")

@task
def always_succeeds_task():
    print("I'm fail safe!")
    return "success"

@flow
def always_succeeds_flow():
    x = always_fails_task.submit().result(raise_on_failure=False)
    y = always_succeeds_task.submit(wait_for=[x])
    return y

if __name__ == "__main__":
    always_succeeds_flow()
```

Running this flow produces the following result &mdash; it succeeds because it returns the future of the task that succeeds:

<div class="terminal">
```bash
18:35:24.965 | INFO    | prefect.engine - Created flow run 'whispering-guan' for flow 'always-succeeds-flow'

18:35:25.232 | ERROR   | Task run 'always_fails_task-96e4be14-0' - Encountered exception during execution:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  ...

18:35:25.265 | ERROR   | Task run 'always_fails_task-96e4be14-0' - Finished in state Failed('Task run encountered an exception.')
18:35:25.289 | INFO    | Flow run 'whispering-guan' - Created task run 'always_succeeds_task-9c27db32-0' for task 'always_succeeds_task'
18:35:25.289 | INFO    | Flow run 'whispering-guan' - Submitted task run 'always_succeeds_task-9c27db32-0' for execution.
I'm fail safe!
18:35:25.335 | INFO    | Task run 'always_succeeds_task-9c27db32-0' - Finished in state Completed()
18:35:25.362 | INFO    | Flow run 'whispering-guan' - Finished in state Completed('All states completed.')
```
</div>

### Return multiple states or futures

If a flow returns a mix of futures and states, the final state is determined by resolving all futures to states, then determining if any of the states are not `COMPLETED`.

```python hl_lines="20"
from prefect import task, flow

@task
def always_fails_task():
    raise ValueError("I am bad task")

@task
def always_succeeds_task():
    return "foo"

@flow
def always_succeeds_flow():
    return "bar"

@flow
def always_fails_flow():
    x = always_fails_task()
    y = always_succeeds_task()
    z = always_succeeds_flow()
    return x, y, z
```

Running this flow produces the following result.
It fails because one of the three returned futures failed.
Note that the final state is `Failed`, but the states of each of the returned futures is included in the flow state:

<div class="terminal">
```bash
20:57:51.547 | INFO    | prefect.engine - Created flow run 'impartial-gorilla' for flow 'always-fails-flow'

```
</div>

!!! note "Returning multiple states"
    When returning multiple states, they must be contained in a `set`, `list`, or `tuple`.
    If other collection types are used, the result of the contained states will not be checked.

### Return a manual state

If a flow returns a manually created state, the final state is determined based on the return value.

```python hl_lines="16-19"
from prefect import task, flow
from prefect.states import Completed, Failed

@task
def always_fails_task():
    raise ValueError("I fail successfully")

@task
def always_succeeds_task():
    print("I'm fail safe!")
    return "success"

@flow
def always_succeeds_flow():
    x = always_fails_task.submit()
    y = always_succeeds_task.submit()
    if y.result() == "success":
        return Completed(message="I am happy with this result")
    else:
        return Failed(message="How did this happen!?")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    always_succeeds_flow()
```

Running this flow produces the following result.

<div class="terminal">
```bash

```
</div>

### Return an object

If the flow run returns _any other object_, then it is marked as completed.

```python hl_lines="10"
from prefect import task, flow

@task
def always_fails_task():
    raise ValueError("I fail successfully")

@flow
def always_succeeds_flow():
    always_fails_task().submit()
    return "foo"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    always_succeeds_flow()
```

Running this flow produces the following result.

<div class="terminal">
```bash
21:02:45.715 | INFO    | prefect.engine - Created flow run 'sparkling-pony' for flow 'always-succeeds-flow'

</div>

## Serving a flow

The simplest way to create a [deployment](/3.0rc/deploy/serve-workflows/) for your flow is by calling its [`serve` method](/3.0rc/api-ref/prefect/flows/#prefect.flows.Flow.serve).
This method creates a deployment for the flow and starts a long-running process that monitors for work from the Prefect server.
When work is found, it is executed within its own isolated subprocess.

```python title="hello_world.py"
from prefect import flow


@flow(log_prints=True)
def hello_world(name: str = "world", goodbye: bool = False):
    print(f"Hello {name} from Prefect! ü§ó")

    if goodbye:
        print(f"Goodbye {name}!")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    # creates a deployment and stays running to monitor for work instructions generated on the server

    hello_world.serve(name="my-first-deployment",
                      tags=["onboarding"],
                      parameters={"goodbye": True},
                      interval=60)
```

This interface provides all of the configuration needed for a deployment with no strong infrastructure requirements:

- schedules
- event triggers
- metadata such as tags and description
- default parameter values

!!! tip "Schedules are auto-paused on shutdown"
    By default, stopping the process running `flow.serve` will pause the schedule for the deployment (if it has one).
    When running this in environments where restarts are expected use the `pause_on_shutdown=False` flag to prevent this behavior:

    ```python hl_lines="5"
    if __name__ == "__main__":
        hello_world.serve(name="my-first-deployment",
                          tags=["onboarding"],
                          parameters={"goodbye": True},
                          pause_on_shutdown=False,
                          interval=60)
    ```

### Serving multiple flows at once

You can take this further and serve multiple flows with the same process using the [`serve`](/3.0rc/api-ref/prefect/runner/#prefect.runner.serve) utility along with the `to_deployment` method of flows:

```python
import time
from prefect import flow, serve


@flow
def slow_flow(sleep: int = 60):
    "Sleepy flow - sleeps the provided amount of time (in seconds)."
    time.sleep(sleep)


@flow
def fast_flow():
    "Fastest flow this side of the Mississippi."
    return


if __name__ == "__main__":
    slow_deploy = slow_flow.to_deployment(name="sleeper", interval=45)
    fast_deploy = fast_flow.to_deployment(name="fast")
    serve(slow_deploy, fast_deploy)
```

The behavior and interfaces are identical to the single flow case.

## Retrieve a flow from remote storage

Flows can be retrieved from remote storage using the [`flow.from_source`](/3.0rc/api-ref/prefect/flows/#prefect.flows.Flow.from_source) method.

`flow.from_source` accepts a git repository URL  and an entrypoint pointing to the flow to load from the repository:

```python title="load_from_url.py"
from prefect import flow

my_flow = flow.from_source(
    source="https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect.git",
    entrypoint="flows/hello_world.py:hello"
)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    my_flow()
```

<div class="terminal">

```bash
16:40:33.818 | INFO    | prefect.engine - Created flow run 'muscular-perch' for flow 'hello'
16:40:34.048 | INFO    | Flow run 'muscular-perch' - Hello world!
16:40:34.706 | INFO    | Flow run 'muscular-perch' - Finished in state Completed()
```

</div>

A flow entrypoint is the path to the file the flow is located in and the name of the flow function separated by a colon.

If you need additional configuration, such as specifying a private repository, you can provide a [`GitRepository`](/3.0rc/api-ref/prefect/flows/#prefect.runner.storage.GitRepository) instead of URL:

```python title="load_from_storage.py"
from prefect import flow
from prefect.runner.storage import GitRepository
from prefect.blocks.system import Secret

my_flow = flow.from_source(
    source=GitRepository(
        url="https://github.com/org/private-repo.git",
        branch="dev",
        credentials={
            "access_token": Secret.load("github-access-token").get()
        }
    ),
    entrypoint="flows.py:my_flow"
)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    my_flow()
```

!!! tip "You can serve loaded flows"
    Flows loaded from remote storage can be served using the same [`serve`](#serving-a-flow) method as local flows:

    ```python title="serve_loaded_flow.py"
    from prefect import flow

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        flow.from_source(
            source="https://github.com/org/repo.git",
            entrypoint="flows.py:my_flow"
        ).serve(name="my-deployment")
    ```

    When you serve a flow loaded from remote storage, the serving process will periodically poll your remote storage for updates to the flow's code. 
    This pattern allows you to update your flow code without restarting the serving process.
