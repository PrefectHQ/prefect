Prefect captures logs for your flow and task runs by default, even if you have not started a 
Prefect server with `prefect server start`. View and filter logs in the UI or 
access log records through the API.

When you run a flow, Prefect automatically logs events for flow runs and task runs, along with any custom 
log handlers you have configured. No configuration is needed to enable Prefect logging.

For example, if you create a simple flow in `flow.py` and a local flow run with `python flow.py`, you'll 
see an example of the log messages created automatically by Prefect:

```bash
16:45:44.534 | INFO    | prefect.engine - Created flow run 'gray-dingo' for flow
'hello-flow'
16:45:44.598 | INFO    | Flow run 'gray-dingo' - Created task run 'hello-task-54135dc1-0'
for task 'hello-task'
Hello world!
16:45:44.650 | INFO    | Task run 'hello-task-54135dc1-0' - Finished in state
Completed(None)
16:45:44.672 | INFO    | Flow run 'gray-dingo' - Finished in state
Completed('All states completed.')
```

See logs for a flow run in the UI by navigating to the **Flow runs** 
page and selecting a specific flow run to inspect.

These log messages are generated based on the configured log levels and message formatters. You can customize the log levels captured 
(e.g. INFO, DEBUG, ERROR) and the default message format through configuration settings. 

Prefect supports the standard Python logging levels `CRITICAL`, `ERROR`, `WARNING`, `INFO`, and `DEBUG`. By default,
Prefect displays `INFO`-level and above events.

Additionally, you can emit custom log messages during flow and task runs to capture specific events or information important to your workflow.

## Logging configuration

Prefect provides several settings to configure logging level and loggers.

Override any logging configuration by setting an environment variable or [Prefect profile](/3.0rc/manage/settings-and-profiles/) 
setting using the syntax `PREFECT_LOGGING_[PATH]_[TO]_[KEY]`, with `[PATH]_[TO]_[KEY]` corresponding to the nested address 
of any setting.

For example, to change the default logging levels for Prefect to `DEBUG`, update your profile with:
```
prefect config set PREFECT_LOGGING_LEVEL="DEBUG"
```
or set the corresponding environment variable:
```
export PREFECT_LOGGING_LEVEL="DEBUG"
```

You can also configure the "root" Python logger. The root logger receives logs from all loggers unless they 
explicitly opt out by disabling propagation. By default, the root logger is configured to output `WARNING` level logs 
to the console. As with other logging settings, you can override this from the environment or in the logging configuration 
file. For example, you can change the level with the `PREFECT_LOGGING_ROOT_LEVEL` environment variable .

You can adjust the log level used by specific handlers. For example, set `PREFECT_LOGGING_HANDLERS_API_LEVEL=ERROR` to have only 
`ERROR` logs reported to the Prefect API. The console handlers will still default to level `INFO`.

A [`logging.yml`](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect/blob/main/src/prefect/logging/logging.yml) file is packaged with 
Prefect that defines the default logging configuration.

### Customize logging configuration

To customize logging configuration, you can create your own version of `logging.yml` in one of two ways:

1. Create a `logging.yml` file in your `PREFECT_HOME` directory (default is `~/.prefect`).
2. Specify a custom path to your `logging.yml` file using the `PREFECT_LOGGING_SETTINGS_PATH` setting.

If Prefect cannot find the `logging.yml` file at the specified location, it will fall back to using the default logging configuration.

See the Python [Logging configuration](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.config.html#logging.config.dictConfig) 
documentation for more information about the configuration options and syntax used by `logging.yml`.

<Note>
As with all Prefect settings, logging settings are loaded at runtime.
This means that to customize Prefect logging in a remote environment requires setting the appropriate environment variables and/or profile in that environment.
</ Note>

## Prefect loggers

To use a Prefect logger, import `get_run_logger` from the `prefect.logging` module. 
This function returns a logger instance that is aware of the current flow or task run context, allowing for more detailed and contextual logging.

### Logging in flows

To log from a flow, retrieve a logger instance with `get_run_logger()`, then call the standard Python 
[logging methods](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html):

```python
from prefect import flow
from prefect.logging import get_run_logger

@flow(name="log-example-flow")
def logger_flow():
    logger = get_run_logger()
    logger.info("INFO level log message.")
```

Prefect automatically uses the flow run logger based on the flow context which formats the
log with the name of the current flow run. If you run the code above, Prefect will log:


```bash
15:35:17.304 | INFO    | Flow run 'mottled-marten' - INFO level log message.
```

### Logging in tasks

Logging in tasks works much like logging in flows: retrieve a logger instance with `get_run_logger()`, then call the standard 
Python [logging methods](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html).

```python
from prefect import flow, task
from prefect.logging import get_run_logger

@task(name="log-example-task")
def logger_task():
    logger = get_run_logger()
    logger.info("INFO level log message from a task.")

@flow(name="log-example-flow")
def logger_flow():
    logger_task()
```

Prefect automatically uses the task run logger based on the task context which formats the
log with the name of the current task run.


```bash
15:33:47.179 | INFO   | Task run 'logger_task-80a1ffd1-0' - INFO level log message from a task.
```

### Logging print statements

Prefect provides the `log_prints` option to enable the logging of `print` statements at the task or flow level. 
When `log_prints=True` for a given task or flow, the Python built-in `print` is patched to redirect to the Prefect 
logger for the scope of that task or flow.

By default, task runs and nested flow runs inherit the `log_prints` setting from their parent flow run, unless opted out with their 
own explicit `log_prints` setting.

```python
from prefect import task, flow

@task
def my_task():
    print("we're logging print statements from a task")

@flow(log_prints=True)
def my_flow():
    print("we're logging print statements from a flow")
    my_task()
```

Outputs:


```bash
15:52:11.244 | INFO    | prefect.engine - Created flow run 'emerald-gharial' for flow 'my-flow'
15:52:11.812 | INFO    | Flow run 'emerald-gharial' - we're logging print statements from a flow
15:52:11.926 | INFO    | Flow run 'emerald-gharial' - Created task run 'my_task-20c6ece6-0' for task 'my_task'
15:52:11.927 | INFO    | Flow run 'emerald-gharial' - Executing 'my_task-20c6ece6-0' immediately...
15:52:12.217 | INFO    | Task run 'my_task-20c6ece6-0' - we're logging print statements from a task
```

```python
from prefect import task, flow

@task
def my_task(log_prints=False):
    print("not logging print statements in this task")

@flow(log_prints=True)
def my_flow():
    print("we're logging print statements from a flow")
    my_task()
```

Using `log_prints=False` at the task level outputs:


```bash
15:52:11.244 | INFO    | prefect.engine - Created flow run 'emerald-gharial' for flow 'my-flow'
15:52:11.812 | INFO    | Flow run 'emerald-gharial' - we're logging print statements from a flow
15:52:11.926 | INFO    | Flow run 'emerald-gharial' - Created task run 'my_task-20c6ece6-0' for task 'my_task'
15:52:11.927 | INFO    | Flow run 'emerald-gharial' - Executing 'my_task-20c6ece6-0' immediately...
not logging print statements in this task
```

Configure this behavior globally for all Prefect flow and task runs


```bash
prefect config set PREFECT_LOGGING_LOG_PRINTS=True
```

## Formatters

Prefect log formatters specify the format of log messages. See details of message formatting for different loggers in 
[`logging.yml`](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect/blob/main/src/prefect/logging/logging.yml). For example, the default 
formatting for task run log records is:

```python
"%(asctime)s.%(msecs)03d | %(levelname)-7s | Task run %(task_run_name)r - %(message)s"
```

The variables available to interpolate in log messages varies by logger. In addition to the run context, message string, 
and any keyword arguments, flow and task run loggers have access to additional variables.

The flow run logger has the following:

- `flow_run_name`
- `flow_run_id`
- `flow_name`

The task run logger has the following:

- `task_run_id`
- `flow_run_id`
- `task_run_name`
- `task_name`
- `flow_run_name`
- `flow_name`

Specify custom formatting by setting an environment variable or by modifying the formatter in a `logging.yml` file as
described earlier. For example, the following changes the formatting for the flow runs formatter:


```bash
PREFECT_LOGGING_FORMATTERS_STANDARD_FLOW_RUN_FMT="%(asctime)s.%(msecs)03d | %(levelname)-7s | %(flow_run_id)s - %(message)s"
```

The resulting messages, using the flow run ID instead of name, look like this:


```bash
10:40:01.211 | INFO    | e43a5a80-417a-41c4-a39e-2ef7421ee1fc - Created task run
'othertask-1c085beb-3' for task 'othertask'
```

## Styles

By default, Prefect highlights specific keywords in the console logs with a variety of colors.

Toggle highlighting on/off with the `PREFECT_LOGGING_COLORS` setting:


```bash
PREFECT_LOGGING_COLORS=False
```

Change what gets highlighted and adjust the colors by updating the styles in a `logging.yml` file. List the specific 
keys built-in to the `PrefectConsoleHighlighter` as shown below:

URLs:

- `log.web_url`
- `log.local_url`

Log levels:

- `log.info_level`
- `log.warning_level`
- `log.error_level`
- `log.critical_level`

State types:

- `log.pending_state`
- `log.running_state`
- `log.scheduled_state`
- `log.completed_state`
- `log.cancelled_state`
- `log.failed_state`
- `log.crashed_state`

Flow (run) names:

- `log.flow_run_name`
- `log.flow_name`

Task (run) names:

- `log.task_run_name`
- `log.task_name`

Build your own handler with a [custom highlighter](https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/stable/highlighting.html#custom-highlighters). 
For example, to additionally highlight emails:

1. Copy and paste the following code into  `my_package_or_module.py` (rename as needed) in the same directory as the flow run 
script; or ideally as part of a Python package so it's available in `site-packages` and accessible anywhere within your environment.

```python
import logging
from typing import Dict, Union

from rich.highlighter import Highlighter

from prefect.logging.handlers import PrefectConsoleHandler
from prefect.logging.highlighters import PrefectConsoleHighlighter

class CustomConsoleHighlighter(PrefectConsoleHighlighter):
    base_style = "log."
    highlights = PrefectConsoleHighlighter.highlights + [
        # ?P<email> is naming this expression as `email`
        r"(?P<email>[\w-]+@([\w-]+\.)+[\w-]+)",
    ]

class CustomConsoleHandler(PrefectConsoleHandler):
    def __init__(
        self,
        highlighter: Highlighter = CustomConsoleHighlighter,
        styles: Dict[str, str] = None,
        level: Union[int, str] = logging.NOTSET,
   ):
        super().__init__(highlighter=highlighter, styles=styles, level=level)
```

2. Update `/.prefect/logging.yml` to use `my_package_or_module.CustomConsoleHandler` and additionally reference the 
base_style and named expression: `log.email`.

```yaml
    console_flow_runs:
        level: 0
        class: my_package_or_module.CustomConsoleHandler
        formatter: flow_runs
        styles:
            log.email: magenta
            # other styles can be appended here, e.g.
            # log.completed_state: green
```

3. On your next flow run, text that looks like an email is highlighted. For example, `my@email.com` is colored in 
magenta below:

```python
from prefect import flow
from prefect.logging import get_run_logger

@flow
def log_email_flow():
    logger = get_run_logger()
    logger.info("my@email.com")

log_email_flow()
```

## Apply markup in logs

To use [Rich's markup](https://rich.readthedocs.io/en/stable/markup.html#console-markup) in Prefect logs, first 
configure `PREFECT_LOGGING_MARKUP`:


```bash
PREFECT_LOGGING_MARKUP=True
```

The following will highlight "fancy" in red:

```python
from prefect import flow
from prefect.logging import get_run_logger

@flow
def my_flow():
    logger = get_run_logger()
    logger.info("This is [bold red]fancy[/]")

my_flow()
```
<Warning>
**Inaccurate logs could result**

If enabled, strings that contain square brackets may be 
inaccurately interpreted and lead to incomplete output. For example, `DROP TABLE [dbo].[SomeTable];"` outputs 
`DROP TABLE .[SomeTable];`.
</Warning>

## Include logs from other libraries

By default, Prefect won't capture log statements from libraries that your flows
and tasks use. You can tell Prefect to include logs from these libraries with
the `PREFECT_LOGGING_EXTRA_LOGGERS` setting.

To use this setting, specify one or more Python library names to include,
separated by commas. For example, if you want Prefect to capture Dask
and SciPy logging statements with your flow and task run logs, use:

`PREFECT_LOGGING_EXTRA_LOGGERS=dask,scipy`

Configure this setting as an environment variable or in a profile. See
[Settings](/3.0rc/manage/settings-and-profiles/) for more details about how to use settings.
