Create `@task` functions that do the specific work of your flow, and use your `@flow` function 
to orchestrate the flow of your application:


The simplest workflow is a `@flow` function that does all the work of the workflow.

```python
from prefect import flow

@flow(name="Hello Flow")
def hello_world(name="world"):
    print(f"Hello {name}!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    hello_world("Marvin")
```

When you run this flow, you see output like the following:

<div class="terminal">
```bash
$ python hello.py
15:11:23.594 | INFO    | prefect.engine - Created flow run 'benevolent-donkey' for flow 'hello-world'
15:11:23.594 | INFO    | Flow run 'benevolent-donkey' - Using task runner 'ConcurrentTaskRunner'
Hello Marvin!
15:11:24.447 | INFO    | Flow run 'benevolent-donkey' - Finished in state Completed()
```
</div>

A better practice is to create `@task` functions that do the specific work of your flow, 
and use your `@flow` function to orchestrate the flow of your application:

```python
from prefect import flow, task

@task(name="Print Hello")
def print_hello(name):
    msg = f"Hello {name}!"
    print(msg)
    return msg

@flow(name="Hello Flow")
def hello_world(name="world"):
    message = print_hello(name)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    hello_world("Marvin")
```

When you run this flow, you see the following output, which illustrates how the work is encapsulated in a task run.

<div class="terminal">
```bash
$ python hello.py
15:15:58.673 | INFO    | prefect.engine - Created flow run 'loose-wolverine' for flow 'Hello Flow'
15:15:58.674 | INFO    | Flow run 'loose-wolverine' - Using task runner 'ConcurrentTaskRunner'
15:15:58.973 | INFO    | Flow run 'loose-wolverine' - Created task run 'Print Hello-84f0fe0e-0' for task 'Print Hello'
Hello Marvin!
15:15:59.037 | INFO    | Task run 'Print Hello-84f0fe0e-0' - Finished in state Completed()
15:15:59.568 | INFO    | Flow run 'loose-wolverine' - Finished in state Completed('All states completed.')
```
</div>
