title: Manage results
description: Results represent the data returned by a flow or a task and enable features such as caching.
---

Results are the bedrock of many Prefect features - most notably [transactions](transactions) 
and [caching](task-caching) - and are foundational to the resilient execution paradigm that Prefect enables.
Any return value from a task or a flow is a result.
By default these results are not persisted and no reference to them is maintained in the API.

Enabling result persistence allows you to fully benefit from Prefect's orchestration features.

<Tip>
**Turn on persistence globally by default**

The simplest way to turn on result persistence globally is through the `PREFECT_RESULTS_PERSIST_BY_DEFAULT` setting:

```bash
prefect config set PREFECT_RESULTS_PERSIST_BY_DEFAULT=true
```

See [settings](/3.0rc/manage/settings-and-profiles) for more information on how settings are managed.
</Tip>

## Configuring result persistence

There are four categories of configuration for result persistence:
- [whether to persist results at all](results#enabling-result-persistence): this is configured through
various keyword arguments and the `PREFECT_RESULTS_PERSIST_BY_DEFAULT` setting.
- [what filesystem to persist results to](results#result-storage): this is configured through the `result_storage` 
keyword and the `PREFECT_DEFAULT_RESULT_STORAGE_BLOCK` setting.
- [how to serialize and deserialize results](results#result-serialization): this is configured through 
the `result_serializer` keyword and the `PREFECT_RESULTS_DEFAULT_SERIALIZER` setting.
- [what filename to use](results#result-filenames): this is configured through one of 
`result_storage_key`, `cache_policy`, or `cache_key_fn`.

### Default persistence configuration

Once result persistence is enabled - whether through the `PREFECT_RESULTS_PERSIST_BY_DEFAULT` setting or 
through any of the mechanisms [described below](results#enabling-result-persistence) - Prefect's default 
result storage configuration is activated.

If you enable result persistence and don't specify a filesystem block, your results will be stored locally.
By default, results are persisted to `~/.prefect/storage/`. 

You can configure the location of these results through the `PREFECT_LOCAL_STORAGE_PATH` setting.

```bash
prefect config set PREFECT_LOCAL_STORAGE_PATH='~/.my-results/'
```

### Enabling result persistence

In addition to the `PREFECT_RESULTS_PERSIST_BY_DEFAULT` setting, result persistence can also be 
enabled or disabled on both individual flows and individual tasks.
Specifying a non-null value for any of the following keywords on the task decorator will enable result 
persistence for that task:
- `persist_result`: a boolean that allows you to explicity enable or disable result persistence.
- `result_storage`: accepts either a string reference to a storage block or a storage block class that
specifies where results should be stored.
- `result_storage_key`: a string that specifies the filename of the result within the task's result storage.
- `result_serializer`: a string or serializer that configures how the data should be serialized and deserialized.
- `cache_policy`: a [cache policy](task-caching#cache-policies) specifying the behavior of the task's cache.
- `cache_key_fn`: [a function](task-caching#cache-key-functions) that configures a custom cache policy.

Similarly, setting `persist_result=True`, `result_storage`, or `result_serializer` on a flow will enable
persistence for that flow.

<Note>
**Enabling persistence on a flow enables persistence by default for its tasks**

Enabling result persistence on a flow through any of the above keywords will also enable it for all
tasks called within that flow by default. 

Any settings _explicitly_ set on a task take precedence over the flow settings.

</Note>

### Result storage

You can configure the system of record for your results through the `result_storage` keyword argument.
This keyword accepts a [filesystem block](blocks) or a block document slug. 
Note that if you want your tasks to share a common cache, your result storage should be accessible by 
the infrastructure in which those tasks run. 
For example, a common distributed filesystem for result storage is AWS S3.

```python
from prefect import flow, task
from prefect_aws.s3 import S3Bucket


test_block = S3Bucket(bucket='test-bucket')
test_block.save('test-block')


# define three tasks
# with different result persistence configuration

@task
def my_task():
    return 42

unpersisted_task = my_task.with_options(persist_result=False)
other_storage_task = my_task.with_options(result_storage=test_block)


@flow(result_storage='s3/my-dev-bucket')
def my_flow():

    # this task will use the flow's result storage
    my_task()  

    # this task will not persist results at all
    unpersisted_task()

    # this task will persist results to its own test bucket using a different S3 block
    other_storage_task()
```

#### Specifying a default filesystem

Alternatively, you can specify a different filesystem through the `PREFECT_DEFAULT_RESULT_STORAGE_BLOCK` setting.
Specifying a block document slug here will enable result persistence using that filesystem as the default.

For example:

```bash
prefect config set PREFECT_DEFAULT_RESULT_STORAGE_BLOCK='s3/my-prod-bucket'
```

<Info>
Note that any explicit configuration of `result_storage` on either a flow or task will override this default.
</Info>

#### Result filenames

By default, the filename of a task's result is computed based on the task's cache policy, 
which is typically a hash of various pieces of data and metadata. 
For flows, the filename is a random UUID.

You can configure the filename of the result file within result storage using either:
- `result_storage_key`: a templated string that can use any of the fields within `prefect.runtime` and
the task's individual parameter values. These templated values will be populated at runtime.
- `cache_key_fn`: a function that accepts the task run context and its runtime parameters and returns
a string. See [task caching documentation](task-caching#cache-key-functions) for more information.

<Warning>
If both `result_storage_key` and `cache_key_fn` are provided, only the `result_storage_key` will be used.
</Warning>

The following example writes three different result files based on the `name` parameter passed to the task:

```python
from prefect import flow, task


@task(result_storage_key="hello-{parameters[name]}.pickle")
def hello_world(name: str = "world"):
    return f"hello {name}"


@flow
def my_flow():
    hello_world()
    hello_world(name="foo")
    hello_world(name="bar")
```

If a result exists at a given storage key in the storage location, the task will load it without running.
To learn more about caching mechanics in Prefect, see the [caching documentation](task-caching).

### Result serialization

You can configure how results are serialized to storage using result serializers.
These can be set using the `result_serializer` keyword on both tasks and flows.
A default value can be set using the `PREFECT_RESULTS_DEFAULT_SERIALIZER` setting, which defaults to `pickle`.
Current built-in options include `"pickle"`, `"json"`, `"compressed/pickle"` and `"compressed/json"`.

The `result_serializer` accepts both a string identifier or an instance of a `ResultSerializer` class, allowing
you to customize serialization behavior.

## Advanced: Caching results in memory

When running workflows, Prefect keeps the results of all tasks and flows in memory 
so they can be passed downstream. In some cases, it is desirable to override this behavior. 
For example, if you are returning a large amount of data from a task, it can be costly to 
keep it in memory for the entire duration of the flow run.

Flows and tasks both include an option to drop the result from memory once the
result has been committed with `cache_result_in_memory`:

```python
@flow(cache_result_in_memory=False)
def foo():
    return "pretend this is large data"

@task(cache_result_in_memory=False)
def bar():
    return "pretend this is biiiig data"
```
