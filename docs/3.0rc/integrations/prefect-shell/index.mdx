title: prefect-shell
---

Execute shell commands from within Prefect flows.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Prefect installed](/getting-started/installation/).

### Install `prefect-shell`

<div class="terminal">
```bash
pip install -U prefect-shell
```
</div>

### Register newly installed block types

Register the block types in the prefect-aws module to make them available for use.

<div class="terminal">
```bash
prefect block register -m prefect_shell
```
</div>

## Examples

### Integrate shell commands with Prefect flows

With prefect-shell, you can use shell commands (and/or scripts) in Prefect flows to provide observability and resiliency.
Prefect-shell can be a useful tool if you're transitioning your orchestration from shell scripts to Prefect.

Let's get the shell-abration started!

The Python code below has shell commands embedded in a Prefect flow:

```python
from prefect import flow
from datetime import datetime
from prefect_shell import ShellOperation


@flow
def download_data():
    today = datetime.today().strftime("%Y%m%d")

    # for short running operations, you can use the `run` method
    # which automatically manages the context
    ShellOperation(
        commands=[
            "mkdir -p data",
            "mkdir -p data/${today}"
        ],
        env={"today": today}
    ).run()

    # for long running operations, you can use a context manager
    with ShellOperation(
        commands=[
            "curl -O https://masie_web.apps.nsidc.org/pub/DATASETS/NOAA/G02135/north/daily/data/N_seaice_extent_daily_v3.0.csv",
        ],
        working_dir=f"data/{today}",
    ) as download_csv_operation:

        # trigger runs the process in the background
        download_csv_process = download_csv_operation.trigger()

        # then do other things here in the meantime, like download another file
        ...

        # when you're ready, wait for the process to finish
        download_csv_process.wait_for_completion()

        # if you'd like to get the output lines, you can use the `fetch_result` method
        output_lines = download_csv_process.fetch_result()


if __name__ == "__main__":
    download_data()
```

Running this script results in output like this:

```bash

### Save shell commands in Prefect Blocks

You can save commands within a `ShellOperation` block, then reuse them across multiple flows.

Save the block with desired commands:

```python
from prefect_shell import ShellOperation


ping_op = ShellOperation(commands=["ping -t 1 prefect.io"])
ping_op.save("block-name")

# Load the saved block:
ping_op = ShellOperation.load("block-name")
```
