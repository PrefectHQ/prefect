The `prefect-email` library helps you send emails from your Prefect flows.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Prefect installed](/getting-started/installation/) in a virtual environment.
- Many email services, such as Gmail, require an [App Password](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833) to successfully send emails.
    If you encounter an error similar to `smtplib.SMTPAuthenticationError: (535, b'5.7.8 Username and Password not accepted...`, it's likely you are not using an App Password.

### Install prefect-email

<div class = "terminal">
```bash
pip install -U prefect-email
```
</div>

### Register newly installed blocks types

Register the block types in the prefect-email module to make them available for use.

<div class = "terminal">
```bash
prefect block register -m prefect_email
```
</div>

## Save credentials to an EmailServerCredentials block

Save your email credentials to a block.
Replace the placeholders with your email address and password.

```python
from prefect_email import EmailServerCredentials

credentials = EmailServerCredentials(
    username="EMAIL-ADDRESS-PLACEHOLDER",
    password="PASSWORD-PLACEHOLDER",  # must be an app password
)
credentials.save("BLOCK-NAME-PLACEHOLDER")
```

In the examples below you load a credentials block to authenticate with the email server.

## Send emails

The code below shows how to send an email using the pre-built `email_send_message` [task](https://docs.prefect.io/latest/concepts/tasks/).

```python
from prefect import flow
from prefect_email import EmailServerCredentials, email_send_message

@flow
def example_email_send_message_flow(email_addresses):
    email_server_credentials = EmailServerCredentials.load("BLOCK-NAME-PLACEHOLDER")
    for email_address in email_addresses:
        subject = email_send_message.with_options(name=f"email {email_address}").submit(
            email_server_credentials=email_server_credentials,
            subject="Example Flow Notification using Gmail",
            msg="This proves email_send_message works!",
            email_to=email_address,
        )

if __name__ == "__main__":
    example_email_send_message_flow(["EMAIL-ADDRESS-PLACEHOLDER"])
```

## Capture exceptions and send an email

This example demonstrates how to send an email notification with the details of the exception when a flow run fails.

`prefect-email` can be wrapped in an `except` statement to do just that!

```python
from prefect import flow
from prefect.context import get_run_context
from prefect_email import EmailServerCredentials, email_send_message

def notify_exc_by_email(exc):
    context = get_run_context()
    flow_run_name = context.flow_run.name
    email_server_credentials = EmailServerCredentials.load("email-server-credentials")
    email_send_message(
        email_server_credentials=email_server_credentials,
        subject=f"Flow run {flow_run_name!r} failed",
        msg=f"Flow run {flow_run_name!r} failed due to {exc}.",
        email_to=email_server_credentials.username,
    )

@flow
def example_flow():
    try:
        1 / 0
    except Exception as exc:
        notify_exc_by_email(exc)
        raise

if __name__ == "__main__":
    example_flow()
```
