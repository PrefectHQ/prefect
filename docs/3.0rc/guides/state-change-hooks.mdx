title: State Change Hooks
description: Execute code in response to a flow or task entering a given state, without involvement of the Prefect API.

[State change hooks](/3.0rc/concepts/states/#state-change-hooks) execute code in response to changes in flow or task run states, enabling you to define actions for specific state transitions in a workflow.
This guide provides examples of real-world use cases.

## Example use cases

### Send a notification when a flow run fails

State change hooks enable you to customize messages sent when tasks transition between states, such as sending notifications containing sensitive information when tasks enter a `Failed` state.
Here's an example of running a client-side hook upon a flow run entering a `Failed` state:

```python
from prefect import flow
from prefect.blocks.core import Block
from prefect.settings import PREFECT_API_URL

def notify_slack(flow, flow_run, state):
    slack_webhook_block = Block.load(
        "slack-webhook/my-slack-webhook"
    )
            
    slack_webhook_block.notify(
        (
            f"Your job {flow_run.name} entered {state.name} "
            f"with message:\n\n"
            f"See <https://{PREFECT_API_URL.value()}/flow-runs/"
            f"flow-run/{flow_run.id}|the flow run in the UI>\n\n"
            f"Tags: {flow_run.tags}\n\n"
            f"Scheduled start: {flow_run.expected_start_time}"
        )
    )

@flow(on_failure=[notify_slack], retries=1)
def failing_flow():
    raise ValueError("oops!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    failing_flow()
```

Note that retries are configured in this example. This means the `on_failure` hook will not run until all `retries` have completed when the flow run enters a `Failed` state.

### Delete a Cloud Run job when a flow run crashes

State change hooks help manage infrastructure cleanup in scenarios where tasks spin up individual infrastructure resources independently of Prefect.
When a flow run crashes, tasks may exit abruptly and result in the potential omission of cleanup logic within the tasks.
Use state change hooks to ensure infrastructure is properly cleaned up, even when a flow run enters a `Crashed` state.

Here's how to create a hook that deletes a Cloud Run job if the flow run crashes:

```python
import os
from prefect import flow, task
from prefect.variables import Variable
from prefect.client import get_client
import prefect.runtime

async def delete_cloud_run_job(flow, flow_run, state):
    """Flow run state change hook that deletes a Cloud Run Job if
    the flow run crashes."""

    # retrieve Cloud Run job name
    cloud_run_job_name = await Variable.get(
        name="crashing-flow_cloud_run_job"
    )

    # delete Cloud Run job
    delete_job_command = f"yes | gcloud beta run jobs delete 
    {cloud_run_job_name.value} --region us-central1"
    os.system(delete_job_command)


@task
def my_task_that_crashes():
    raise SystemExit("Crashing on purpose!")

@flow(on_crashed=[delete_cloud_run_job])
def crashing_flow():
    """Save the flow run name (i.e. Cloud Run job name) as a 
    Variable. It then executes a task that ends up crashing."""
    flow_run_name = prefect.runtime.flow_run.name
    cloud_run_job_name = Variable.set(name="crashing_flow_cloud_run_job", value=flow_run_name, overwrite=True)

    my_task_that_crashes()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    crashing_flow()
```
