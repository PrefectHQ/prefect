[Prefect recipes](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect-recipes) are common, extensible examples for setting up Prefect in your execution environment with ready-made ingredients such as Dockerfiles, Terraform files, and GitHub Actions.

These recipes show you how to deploy a worker, use event-driven flows, set up unit testing, and more.

The following recipes are specific to Prefect 2. You can find a full repository of recipes at [https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect-recipes](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect-recipes) and additional recipes at [Prefect Discourse](https://discourse.prefect.io/).

## Contributing recipes

We're always looking for new recipe contributions! See the [Prefect Recipes](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect-recipes#contributing--swag-) repository for details about how to add your Prefect recipe, share best practices with fellow Prefect users, and earn some swag.

[Prefect recipes](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect-recipes) provide a vital cookbook where users can find helpful code examples and common steps for specific Prefect use cases.

Contribute recipes that other Prefect users could benefit from (for example, a Prefect flow that loads data into Snowflake).

Have a blog post, Discourse article, or tutorial you’d like to share as a recipe? All submissions are welcome. Clone the prefect-recipes repo, create a branch, add a link to your recipe to the README, and submit a PR.

## Steps to add your recipe

How to create a recipe:

<div class="terminal">
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone git@github.com:PrefectHQ/prefect-recipes.git
cd prefect-recipes

# Create and checkout a new branch

git checkout -b new_recipe_branch_name

```
</div>

1. [Add your recipe](#what-are-the-common-ingredients-of-a-good-recipe). Your code may simply be a copy/paste of a single Python file or an entire folder. If you're unsure where to add your file or folder, add it under the `flows-advanced/` folder. A Prefect Recipes maintainer will help you find the best place for your recipe. To direct others to a project you made, such as a repo or a blogpost, link to it in the [Prefect Recipes README](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect-recipes#readme).
2. (Optional) Write a [README](#what-are-some-tips-for-a-good-recipe-readme).
3. Include a dependencies file, if applicable.
4. Push your code and make a PR to the repository.

## Common ingredients of a good recipe

- Easy to understand: Can a user easily follow your recipe? Would a README or code comments help? A simple explanation providing context on how to use the example code is useful, but not required. A good README can set a recipe apart, so we have some additional suggestions for README files below.
- Code and more: Sometimes a use case is best represented in Python code or shell scripts. Sometimes a configuration file is the most important artifact &mdash; think of a Dockerfile or Terraform file for configuring infrastructure.
- All-inclusive: Share as much code as you can. Even boilerplate code like Dockerfiles or Terraform or Helm files are useful. Just *don’t share company secrets or IP*.
- Specific: Don't worry about generalizing your code. Other users will extrapolate their own unique solutions from your example.

## Tips for a good recipe README

A thoughtful README can take a recipe from good to great. Here are some best practices for a great recipe README:

- Provide a brief explanation of what your recipe demonstrates. This helps users determine quickly whether the recipe is relevant to their needs or answers their questions.
- List which files are included and what each is meant to do. Each explanation can contain only a few words.
- Describe any dependencies and prerequisites (in addition to any dependencies you include in a requirements file). This includes both libraries or modules and any services your recipe depends upon.
- If steps are involved or there’s an order to do things, a simple list of steps is helpful.
- Bonus: include troubleshooting steps or tips where other users might get tripped up.
