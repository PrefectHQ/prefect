| __[Flows](/3.0rc/develop/write-workflows)__                       | A Prefect workflow, defined as a Python function.             |
| __[Tasks](/3.0rc/develop/write-tasks)__                       | Discrete units of work in a Prefect workflow.                |
| __[Deployments](/3.0rc/deploy/serve-workflows)__           | A server-side concept that encapsulates flow metadata, allowing it to be scheduled and triggered via API. |
| __[Work Pools & Workers](/3.0rc/deploy/dynamic-infra/control-runs)__   | Use Prefect to dynamically provision and configure infrastructure in your execution environment.    |
| __[Schedules](/3.0rc/deploy/serve-workflows/add-schedules)__               | Tell the Prefect API how to create new flow runs for you automatically on a specified cadence.     |
| __[Results](/3.0rc/develop/interact-with-data)__                   | The data returned by a flow or a task.                                 |
| __[Artifacts](/3.0rc/develop/observe-workflows/create-artifacts)__               | Formatted outputs rendered in the Prefect UI, such as markdown, tables, or links.  
| __[States](/3.0rc/develop/observe-workflows/manage-states)__                     | Rich objects that capture the status of a particular task run or flow run.                                                                            |
| __[Blocks](/3.0rc/develop/connect-third-party)__                     | Prefect primitives that enable the storage of configuration and provide a UI interface.          |
| __[Task Runners](/3.0rc/develop/write-tasks/use-task-runners)__         | Configure how tasks are run - concurrently, in parallel, or in a distributed environment. |
| __[Automations](/3.0rc/react/understand-events/automations-triggers)__           | Configure actions that Prefect executes automatically based on trigger conditions.         |
