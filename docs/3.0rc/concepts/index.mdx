| __[Flows](/3.0rc/concepts/flows)__                       | A Prefect workflow, defined as a Python function.             |
| __[Tasks](/3.0rc/concepts/tasks)__                       | Discrete units of work in a Prefect workflow.                |
| __[Deployments](/3.0rc/concepts/deployments)__           | A server-side concept that encapsulates flow metadata, allowing it to be scheduled and triggered via API. |
| __[Work Pools & Workers](/3.0rc/concepts/work-pools)__   | Use Prefect to dynamically provision and configure infrastructure in your execution environment.    |
| __[Schedules](/3.0rc/concepts/schedules)__               | Tell the Prefect API how to create new flow runs for you automatically on a specified cadence.     |
| __[Results](/3.0rc/concepts/results)__                   | The data returned by a flow or a task.                                 |
| __[Artifacts](/3.0rc/concepts/artifacts)__               | Formatted outputs rendered in the Prefect UI, such as markdown, tables, or links.  
| __[States](/3.0rc/concepts/states)__                     | Rich objects that capture the status of a particular task run or flow run.                                                                            |
| __[Blocks](/3.0rc/concepts/blocks)__                     | Prefect primitives that enable the storage of configuration and provide a UI interface.          |
| __[Task Runners](/3.0rc/concepts/task-runners)__         | Configure how tasks are run - concurrently, in parallel, or in a distributed environment. |
| __[Automations](/3.0rc/concepts/automations)__           | Configure actions that Prefect executes automatically based on trigger conditions.         |
