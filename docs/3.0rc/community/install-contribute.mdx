title: Install for development
---

Thanks for contributing to Prefect!

## Set up a development environment

First, download the source code and install an editable copy of the Prefect Python package:

```python
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect.git
cd prefect

# We recommend using a virtual environment. Below we use venv

python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install the package with development dependencies

pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Set up pre-commit hooks for required formatting

pre-commit install

```


If you don't want to install the pre-commit hooks, manually install the formatting dependencies with:

```
pip install $(./scripts/precommit-versions.py)

```


Run `ruff check` and `ruff format`.

After installation, you can run the test suite with `pytest`:

```
# Run all the tests
pytest tests

# Run a subset of tests

pytest tests/test_flows.py

```

<Tip>
**Build the Prefect UI**

If you intend to run a local Prefect server during development, first build the UI. 
See [UI development](#ui-development) for instructions.

## Prefect Code of Conduct

### Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making 
participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone. This is regardless of age, body size, 
disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, 
nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

### Our standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

*   Using welcoming and inclusive language
*   Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
*   Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
*   Focusing on what is best for the community
*   Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

*   The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
*   Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
*   Public or private harassment
*   Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
*   Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

### Our responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior. They are expected to take appropriate and 
fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, 
and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct. They may ban—temporarily or permanently—any contributor for 
other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

### Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces. It also applies when an individual represents the project or its 
community in public spaces. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, 
posting through an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. 
Project maintainers may further clarify what "representation of a project" means.

### Enforcement

Report instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior by contacting Chris White at 
[chris@prefect.io](mailto:chris@prefect.io). All complaints are reviewed and investigated. Each complaint will receive a 
response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain 
confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted 
separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent 
repercussions, as determined by other members of the project's leadership.

### Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/), version 1.4, 
available at [https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct.html](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct.html)

For answers to common questions about this code of conduct, see [https://www.contributor-covenant.org/faq](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/faq)

## Developer Tooling 

The Prefect CLI provides several helpful commands to aid development.

Start all services with hot-reloading on code changes (requires installation of UI dependencies):

```
prefect dev start
```

Start a Prefect API that reloads on code changes:

```
prefect dev api
```

Start a Prefect worker that reloads on code changes:

```
prefect dev agent
```

### UI development

Developing the Prefect UI requires installation of [npm](https://github.com/npm/cli).

Start a development UI that reloads on code changes:

```
prefect dev ui
```

Build the static UI (the UI served by `prefect server start`):

```
prefect dev build-ui
```

### Docs Development

Prefect uses [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) for the docs website and the [mkdocs-material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) 
theme. While we use `mkdocs-material-insiders` for production, builds can still happen without the extra plugins. Deploy previews 
are available on pull requests, so you can browse the final look of your changes before merging.

To build the docs:
```
mkdocs build
```

To serve the docs locally at [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/):
```
mkdocs serve
```

For additional mkdocs help and options:
```
mkdocs --help
```

We use the [mkdocs-material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) theme. To add additional JavaScript or CSS to the docs, 
please see the theme documentation [here](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/customization/).

Internal developers can install the production theme by running:

```
pip install -e git+https://github.com/PrefectHQ/mkdocs-material-insiders.git#egg=mkdocs-material
mkdocs build # or mkdocs build --config-file mkdocs.insiders.yml if needed

```


### Kubernetes development

Generate a manifest to deploy a development API to a local kubernetes cluster:

```
prefect dev kubernetes-manifest

```


To access the Prefect UI running in a Kubernetes cluster, use the `kubectl port-forward` command to forward a port on your local 
machine to an open port within the cluster. For example:

```
kubectl port-forward deployment/prefect-dev 4200:4200

```


This forwards port 4200 on the default internal loop IP for localhost to the Prefect server deployment.

To tell the local `prefect` command how to communicate with the Prefect API running in Kubernetes, set the `PREFECT_API_URL` 
environment variable:

```
export PREFECT_API_URL=http://localhost:4200/api

```


Since you previously configured port forwarding for the localhost port to the Kubernetes environment, you can interact 
with the Prefect API running in Kubernetes when using local Prefect CLI commands.

### Add database migrations

To make changes to a table, first update the SQLAlchemy model in `src/prefect/server/database/orm_models.py`. For example, 
to add a new column to the `flow_run` table, add a new column to the `FlowRun` model:

```
# src/prefect/server/database/orm_models.py

@declarative_mixin
class ORMFlowRun(ORMRun):
    """SQLAlchemy model of a flow run."""
    ...
    new_column = Column(String, nullable=True) # <-- add this line

```


Next, you will generate new migration files. You must generate a new migration file for each database type. 
Migrations are generated for whatever database type `PREFECT_API_DATABASE_CONNECTION_URL` is set to. 
See [how to set the database connection URL](/3.0rc/cloud/self-host#database-settings) for 
each database type.

To generate a new migration file, run:

```
prefect server database revision --autogenerate -m "<migration name>"

```


Make your migration name brief but descriptive. For example:

*   `add_flow_run_new_column`
*   `add_flow_run_new_column_idx`
*   `rename_flow_run_old_column_to_new_column`

The `--autogenerate` flag automatically generates a migration file based on the changes to the models.

<Warning>
**Always inspect the output of `--autogenerate`**


`--autogenerate` generates a migration file based on the changes to the models. However, it is not perfect. Check 
the file to make sure it only includes the changes you want. Additionally, you may need to remove extra statements that 
were included and not related to your change.
</Warning>

The new migration is in the `src/prefect/server/database/migrations/versions/` directory. Each database type has its 
own subdirectory. For example, the SQLite migrations are stored in `src/prefect/server/database/migrations/versions/sqlite/`.

After you inspect the migration file, you can apply the migration to your database by running:

```
prefect server database upgrade -y

```


Once you successfully create and apply migrations for all database types, update `MIGRATION-NOTES.md` to 
document your additions.
