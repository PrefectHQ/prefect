title: Quickstart
description: Get started with Prefect, the easiest way to orchestrate and observe your data pipelines
---

Prefect is an orchestration and observability platform that empowers developers to build and scale code quickly, turning Python scripts into resilient, recurring workflows. Take a Python script to a production-ready, remotely running workflow in a few minutes.

In this quickstart, you'll schedule your code on a remote infrastructure and observe the state of your workflows.

## Example

This basic script fetches statistics about the [main Prefect GitHub repository](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect).

```python
import httpx

def get_repo_info():
    url = "https://api.github.com/repos/PrefectHQ/prefect"
    response = httpx.get(url)
    repo = response.json()
    print("PrefectHQ/prefect repository statistics 🤓:")
    print(f"Stars 🌠 : {repo['stargazers_count']}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    get_repo_info()
```

The following steps convert this example to a schedulable, observable, resilient, and deployable workflow.

## Install Prefect

```bash
pip install -U prefect
```

See the [install guide](/3.0rc/get-started/install/) for more detailed installation instructions, if needed.

## Connect to Prefect's API

Much of Prefect's functionality is backed by a hosted API. The fastest and most foolproof solution is a Prefect-hosted API:

1. Head to [https://app.prefect.cloud/](https://app.prefect.cloud/) and sign in or create a forever-free Prefect Cloud account.
1. Use the `prefect cloud login` CLI command to log in to Prefect Cloud from your development environment.

```bash
prefect cloud login
```

Choose **Log in with a web browser** and click the **Authorize** button in the browser window that opens.
Your CLI is now authenticated with your Prefect Cloud account through a locally-stored API key that expires in 30 days.

If you have any issues with browser-based authentication, see the [Prefect Cloud docs](/3.0rc/cloud/manage-users/api-keys/) to learn how to authenticate with a manually created API key.

<Note>
If you would like to run a Prefect server instance on your own infrastructure, see the [Host a Prefect server instance](/3.0rc/cloud/self-host/) docs.
Note that you need to both host your own server and run flows on your own infrastructure.
</Note>

## Convert your function to a Prefect flow

The easiest way convert a Python function into a workflow is to add a `@flow` decorator.
[Flows](/3.0rc/develop/write-workflows/) are the core observable, deployable units in Prefect and are the primary entrypoint to orchestrated work.

```python my_gh_workflow.py
import httpx   # an HTTP client library and dependency of Prefect
from prefect import flow, task


@task(retries=2)
def get_repo_info(repo_owner: str, repo_name: str):
    """Get info about a repo - will retry twice after failing"""
    url = f"https://api.github.com/repos/{repo_owner}/{repo_name}"
    api_response = httpx.get(url)
    api_response.raise_for_status()
    repo_info = api_response.json()
    return repo_info


@task
def get_contributors(repo_info: dict):
    """Get contributors for a repo"""
    contributors_url = repo_info["contributors_url"]
    response = httpx.get(contributors_url)
    response.raise_for_status()
    contributors = response.json()
    return contributors


@flow(log_prints=True)
def repo_info(repo_owner: str = "PrefectHQ", repo_name: str = "prefect"):
    """
    Given a GitHub repository, logs the number of stargazers
    and contributors for that repo.
    """
    repo_info = get_repo_info(repo_owner, repo_name)
    print(f"Stars 🌠 : {repo_info['stargazers_count']}")

    contributors = get_contributors(repo_info)
    print(f"Number of contributors 👷: {len(contributors)}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    repo_info()
```

The `log_prints=True` argument provided to the `@flow` decorator logs output from `print` statements within the function.

The flow calls two tasks, defined by the `@task` decorator. Tasks are the smallest unit of observed and orchestrated work in Prefect.

Run the script:

```bash
python my_gh_workflow.py
```

Prefect automatically tracks the state of the flow run and logs the output in the UI and CLI.

```bash
14:28:31.099 | INFO    | prefect.engine - Created flow run 'energetic-panther' for flow 'repo-info'
14:28:31.100 | INFO    | Flow run 'energetic-panther' - View at https://app.prefect.cloud/account/123/workspace/abc/flow-runs/flow-run/xyz

14:28:33.255 | INFO    | Flow run 'energetic-panther' - Finished in state Completed('All states completed.')
```

## Deploy on a remote infrastructure

Running a flow locally is a good start, but a remote destination is used for production. Tell Prefect where to run the workflow by creating a [work pool](/3.0rc/deploy/dynamic-infra/control-runs/).

Prefect Cloud can run the flow code using a [Prefect Managed work pool](/3.0rc/deploy/serve-workflows/index). You can create a work pool in the UI or from the CLI.

```bash
prefect work-pool create my-managed-pool --type prefect:managed
```

You'll see the work pool created by the CLI. You can also view your new work pool on the **Work Pools** page of the UI.

## Make your code schedulable

The final step is to convert the script from one that can be run on command remotely to a script automatically executed remotely on a schedule. 

A [deployment](/3.0rc/deploy/serve-workflows/) schedules a flow function to run in your work pool. Deployments elevate flows to remotely configurable entities that have their own API.

This next script builds a deployment, identifying:

- Source for the code to deploy (here, a GitHub repo)
- Specific flow to run (`my_gh_workflow.py:repo_info`)
- Work pool target (`my-managed-pool`)
- Cron schedule (1am every day)

<Info>
This example uses Prefect's own GitHub repo. To test with your own code, push your script to your GitHub account and update the `source` argument accordingly.
</Info>

```bash create_deployment.py
from prefect import flow

if __name__ == "__main__":
    flow.from_source(
        source="https://github.com/prefecthq/demos.git",
        entrypoint="my_gh_workflow.py:repo_info",
    ).deploy(
        name="my-first-deployment",
        work_pool_name="my-managed-pool",
        cron="0 1 * * *",
    )
```

<Tip>
You can store your flow code in nearly any location as long as Prefect can access it. This example uses a GitHub repository, but you could bake your code into a Docker image or store it in cloud provider storage. Read [Where to store your flow code](/3.0rc/deploy/dynamic-infra/retrieve-workflow-code) for details.
</Tip>

Run the script to create the deployment on the Prefect Cloud server.

```bash
python create_deployment.py
```

You see a message that your deployment was created:

```bash
Successfully created/updated all deployments!
______________________________________________________
|                    Deployments                     |  
______________________________________________________
|    Name                       |  Status  | Details |
______________________________________________________
| repo-info/my-first-deployment | applied  |         |
______________________________________________________
```

The previous command creates the deployment in Prefect, without starting it. To schedule a run for the deployment, use:

```bash
prefect deployment run 'repo-info/my-first-deployment'
```

You can also run your flow via the Prefect UI on the **Deployments** page.

The deployment is configured to run on a Prefect Managed work pool, so Prefect automatically spins up the infrastructure to run the flow. 

After a minute or so, you should see the flow run graph and logs on the Flow Run page in the UI.

![Managed flow run graph and logs](/3.0rc/img/ui/qs-flow-run.png)

<Warning>
    After testing this process, click the **Remove** button in the top right of the **Deployment** page so that the workflow is no longer scheduled to run once per day.
</Warning>

## Next steps

You've seen how to move from a Python script to a scheduled, observable, remotely orchestrated workflow with Prefect. Now considering reading: 

* [Write workflows](/3.0rc/develop/write-workflows/index)
* [Write tasks](/3.0rc/develop/write-tasks/index)
* [Self-host](/3.0rc/cloud/self-host) your Prefect server
