import Installation from '/snippets/installation.mdx'

Prefect is an orchestration and observability platform that empowers developers to build and scale workflows quickly.
In this quickstart, you will use Prefect to convert the following Python script to a schedulable, observable, resilient, and deployable workflow in minutes:

```python
import httpx

def get_repo_info():
    """Fetch statistics about the Prefect repository"""
    url = "https://api.github.com/repos/PrefectHQ/prefect"
    response = httpx.get(url)
    repo = response.json()
    print("PrefectHQ/prefect repository statistics 🤓:")
    print(f"Stars 🌠 : {repo['stargazers_count']}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    get_repo_info()
```

## Install Prefect

<Installation />

<Tip>
If needed, see [Install Prefect](/3.0rc/get-started/install/) for other options.
</Tip>

## Connect to Prefect's API

Connect to the Prefect API, either Prefect Cloud hosted by us, or a local Prefect server instance:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Prefect Cloud">
1. Head to [https://app.prefect.cloud/](https://app.prefect.cloud/) and sign in or create a forever-free Prefect Cloud account.
1. Log in to Prefect Cloud from your development environment:

   ```bash
   prefect cloud login
   ```

1. Choose **Log in with a web browser** and click the **Authorize** button in the browser window that opens.

Your CLI is now authenticated with your Prefect Cloud account through a locally-stored API key that expires in 30 days.

If you have any issues with browser-based authentication, you can [authenticate with a manually created API key](/3.0rc/manage/cloud/manage-users/api-keys/) instead.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Local server">
1. Ensure your current profile isn't authenticated to Prefect Cloud:

   ```bash
   prefect cloud logout
   ```

1. Start a local API server:

   ```bash
   prefect server start
   ```

1. Open the Prefect dashboard in your browser at [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200).
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Convert your script to a Prefect workflow

The easiest way to convert a Python script into a workflow is to add a `@flow` decorator to the script's entrypoint, the Python function that runs first.
[Flows](/3.0rc/develop/write-flows/) are containers for workflow logic as code. 
They're the core observable, orchestrated, deployable units of work in Prefect.

Adding `@task` decorators to the functions called by the flow converts them to tasks. 
Tasks receive metadata about upstream dependencies and the state of those dependencies before they run.
Prefect will record these dependencies and states as it orchestrates these tasks when they run.

```python my_gh_workflow.py
import httpx   # an HTTP client library and dependency of Prefect
from prefect import flow, task

@task(retries=2)
def get_repo_info(repo_owner: str, repo_name: str):
    """Get info about a repo - will retry twice after failing"""
    url = f"https://api.github.com/repos/{repo_owner}/{repo_name}"
    api_response = httpx.get(url)
    api_response.raise_for_status()
    repo_info = api_response.json()
    return repo_info

@task
def get_contributors(repo_info: dict):
    """Get contributors for a repo"""
    contributors_url = repo_info["contributors_url"]
    response = httpx.get(contributors_url)
    response.raise_for_status()
    contributors = response.json()
    return contributors

@flow(log_prints=True)
def repo_info(repo_owner: str = "PrefectHQ", repo_name: str = "prefect"):
    """
    Given a GitHub repository, logs the number of stargazers
    and contributors for that repo.
    """
    repo_info = get_repo_info(repo_owner, repo_name)
    print(f"Stars 🌠 : {repo_info['stargazers_count']}")

    contributors = get_contributors(repo_info)
    print(f"Number of contributors 👷: {len(contributors)}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    repo_info()
```

<Note>
The `log_prints=True` argument provided to the `@flow` decorator logs output from `print` statements within the function.
</Note>

## Run your flow

Run your Prefect flow just as you would a Python script:

```bash
python my_gh_workflow.py
```

Prefect automatically tracks the state of the flow run and logs the output in the UI and CLI.

```bash
14:28:31.099 | INFO    | prefect.engine - Created flow run 'energetic-panther' for flow 'repo-info'
14:28:31.100 | INFO    | Flow run 'energetic-panther' - View at https://app.prefect.cloud/account/123/workspace/abc/flow-runs/flow-run/xyz
14:28:32.178 | INFO    | Flow run 'energetic-panther' - Created task run 'get_repo_info-0' for task 'get_repo_info'
14:28:32.179 | INFO    | Flow run 'energetic-panther' - Executing 'get_repo_info-0' immediately...

14:28:33.255 | INFO    | Flow run 'energetic-panther' - Finished in state Completed('All states completed.')
```

## Create a work pool

Running a flow locally is a good start, but you should use a remote destination for production flows.
A [work pool](/3.0rc/deploy/infrastructure-concepts/work-pools/) is the most common way to do this.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Prefect Cloud">
Deploy your flow to Cloud using a managed work pool.

1. Create a [managed work pool](/3.0rc/deploy/infrastructure-concepts/work-pools):

   ```bash
   prefect work-pool create my-work-pool --type prefect:managed
   ```

1. View your new work pool on the **Work Pools** page of the UI.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Local server">
Deploy your flow to your local server using a Process type work pool.

1. Create a Process type work pool:

   ```bash
   prefect work-pool create --type process my-work-pool
   ```

1. Verify that the work pool exists:

   ```bash
   prefect work-pool ls
   ```

1. Start a worker in the work pool:

   ```bash
   prefect worker start --pool my-work-pool
   ```

<Tip>
You can also choose from other [work pool types](https://docs.prefect.io/concepts/work-pools/#worker-types).
</Tip>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Deploy and schedule your flow

A [deployment](/3.0rc/deploy/infrastructure-examples/docker/) is used to determine when, where, and how a flow function should run.
Deployments elevate flows to remotely configurable entities that have their own API.

1. Create a deployment script:

   ```bash create_deployment.py
   from prefect import flow

   # Source for the code to deploy (here, a GitHub repo)
   SOURCE_REPO="https://github.com/prefecthq/demos.git"

   if __name__ == "__main__":
       flow.from_source(
           source=SOURCE_REPO,
           entrypoint="my_gh_workflow.py:repo_info", # Specific flow to run
       ).deploy(
           name="my-first-deployment",
           work_pool_name="my-work-pool", # Work pool target
           cron="0 1 * * *", # Cron schedule (1am every day)
       )
   ```

   <Tip>
   You can store your flow code in nearly any location as long as Prefect can access it.
   See [Where to store your flow code](/3.0rc/deploy/infrastructure-concepts/store-flow-code) for more details.
   </Tip>

1. Run the script to create the deployment:

   ```bash
   python create_deployment.py
   ```

   Check the logs to ensure your deployment was created:

   ```bash
   Successfully created/updated all deployments!
   ______________________________________________________
   |                    Deployments                     |  
   ______________________________________________________
   |    Name                       |  Status  | Details |
   ______________________________________________________
   | repo-info/my-first-deployment | applied  |         |
   ______________________________________________________
   ```

1. Schedule a run for the deployment:

   ```bash
   prefect deployment run 'repo-info/my-first-deployment'
   ```

   After a minute or so, you should see the flow run graph and logs on the Flow Run page in the UI.

   ![Flow run graph and logs](/3.0rc/img/ui/qs-flow-run.png)

1. When you're done, click the **More** > **Delete** button on the **Deployments** page to stop further scheduled runs.
