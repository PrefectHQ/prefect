title: Access third-party secrets 
description: Connect to services without storing credentials in blocks.
---

Credential blocks and secret blocks are popular ways to store and retrieve sensitive information for 
connecting to third-party services.
In Prefect Cloud, these block values are stored in encrypted format, allowing you to use Prefect to 
connect to third-party services securely.

This example interacts with a Snowflake database and stores the credentials required to connect in 
AWS Secrets Manager.
This example uses Prefect Cloud and generally works with other third-party services that require 
credentials.

## Prerequisites

1. Prefect [installed](/3.0rc/get-started/install)
1. CLI authenticated to your [Prefect Cloud](https://app.prefect.cloud) account
1. [Snowflake account](https://www.snowflake.com/)
1. [AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/)

## Steps

### Step 1: Install `prefect-aws` and `prefect-snowflake` libraries

The following code installs and upgrades the necessary libraries and their dependencies:

```bash
pip install -U prefect-aws prefect-snowflake
```

### Step 2: Store Snowflake password in AWS Secrets Manager

Go to the [AWS Secrets Manager](https://aws.amazon.com/secrets-manager/) console and create a new secret.
Alternatively, create a secret using the AWS CLI or a script.

1. In the UI, choose **Store a new secret**.
1. Select **Other type of secret**.
1. Input the key-value pair for your Snowflake password where the key is any string and the value is your 
Snowflake password.
1. Copy the key for future reference and click **Next**.
1. Enter a name for your secret, copy the name, and click **Next**.
1. For this demo, you won't rotate the key, so click **Next**.
1. Click **Store**.

### Step 3: Create `AwsSecret` block to access your Snowflake password

Create blocks with Python code or through the Prefect UI. Block creation through the UI helps you visualize 
how the pieces fit together.

On the Blocks page, click on **+** to add a new block and select **AWS Secret** from the list of block types.
Enter a name for your block and enter the secret name from AWS Secrets Manager.

<Note>
If you're using a self-hosted Prefect server instance, you must register the block types in the 
newly installed modules before creating blocks.
</Note>

```bash
prefect block register -m prefect_aws && prefect block register -m prefect_snowflake
```

### Step 4: Create `AwsCredentials` block

In the **AwsCredentials** section, click **Add +** to create an AWS Credentials block.

Values for **Access Key ID** and **Secret Access Key** are read from the compute environment.
Your AWS **Access Key ID** and **Secret Access Key** values with permissions to read the AWS Secret are 
stored locally in your `~/.aws/credentials` file, so leave those fields blank.
By leaving those attributes blank, Prefect knows to look to the compute environment.

Specify a region in your `AWSCredentials` block instead of your local AWS config file. The `AwsCredentials` 
block takes precedence and is more portable.

Under the hood, Prefect uses the AWS `boto3` client to create a session.

In the **AwsCredentials** section of the form, click **Add +** and create an AWS Credentials block by 
entering the necessary values.

If the compute environment contains the necessary credentials, Prefect will use them to authenticate in the 
order shown in the [Boto3 docs](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/credentials.html#configuring-credentials).

Follow the same order to resolve the AWS region.
Specify the region in your `AWSCredentials` block so your connection works regardless of the contents 
of your local AWS config file—or whether you run your code on AWS compute located in anther region than your secret.

Click **Create** to save the blocks.

### Step 5: Ensure the compute environment has access to AWS credentials

Ensure the compute environment contains AWS credentials with authorization to access AWS Secrets Manager.
When you connect to Snowflake, Prefect automatically uses these credentials to authenticate and access the 
AWS secret that contains the Snowflake password.

### Step 6:Create and use `SnowflakeCredentials` and `SnowflakeConnector` blocks in Python code

Use Prefect's blocks for convenient access to Snowflake.
Don't save the blocks to ensure the credentials are not stored in Prefect Cloud.

Create a flow that connects to Snowflake and calls two tasks.
The first task creates a table and inserts some data.
The second task reads the data out.

```python
import json
from prefect import flow, task
from prefect_aws import AwsSecret
from prefect_snowflake import SnowflakeConnector, SnowflakeCredentials


@task
def setup_table(snow_connector: SnowflakeConnector) -> None:
    with snow_connector as connector:
        connector.execute(
            "CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS customers (name varchar, address varchar);"
        )
        connector.execute_many(
            "INSERT INTO customers (name, address) VALUES (%(name)s, %(address)s);",
            seq_of_parameters=[
                {"name": "Ford", "address": "Highway 42"},
                {"name": "Unknown", "address": "Space"},
                {"name": "Me", "address": "Myway 88"},
            ],
        )


@task
def fetch_data(snow_connector: SnowflakeConnector) -> list:
    all_rows = []
    with snow_connector as connector:
        while True:
            new_rows = connector.fetch_many("SELECT * FROM customers", size=2)
            if len(new_rows) == 0:
                break
            all_rows.append(new_rows)
    return all_rows


@flow(log_prints=True)
def snowflake_flow():
    aws_secret_block = AwsSecret.load("my-snowflake-pw")

    snow_connector = SnowflakeConnector(
        schema="MY_SCHEMA",
        database="MY_DATABASE",
        warehouse="COMPUTE_WH",
        fetch_size=1,
        credentials=SnowflakeCredentials(
            role="MYROLE",
            user="MYUSERNAME",
            account="ab12345.us-east-2.aws",
            password=json.loads(aws_secret_block.read_secret()).get("my-snowflake-pw"),
        ),
        poll_frequency_s=1,
    )

    setup_table(snow_connector)
    all_rows = fetch_data(snow_connector)
    print(all_rows)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    snowflake_flow()
```

Fill in the relevant details for your Snowflake account and run the script.

<Note>
The flow reads the Snowflake password from the AWS Secret Manager and uses it in the 
`SnowflakeCredentials` block.
</Note>

The `SnowflakeConnector` block uses the nested `SnowflakeCredentials` block to connect to Snowflake.
Again, neither of the Snowflake blocks are saved, so the credentials are not stored in Prefect Cloud.

See [`prefect-snowflake`](/integrations/prefect-snowflake) for more examples of working with Snowflake.

## Next steps

Now you can turn your flow into a [deployment](/3.0rc/deploy/control-runs/prefect-deploy/) so you and your team 
can run it remotely on a schedule, in response to an event, or manually.  

Make sure to specify the `prefect-aws` and `prefect-snowflake` dependencies in your work pool or deployment 
so they are available at runtime.

Also ensure your compute has the proper AWS credentials to access the secret in AWS Secrets Manager.

You've seen how to use Prefect blocks to store non-sensitive configuration and fetch sensitive configuration 
values from the environment. You can use this pattern to connect to other third-party services that require 
credentials, such as databases and APIs. You can use a similar pattern with any secret manager, or extend it 
to work with environment variables.
