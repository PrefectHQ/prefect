title: Upgrade to Prefect 3
description: Learn how to upgrade from Prefect 2 to Prefect 3.
---

Prefect 3 is the most flexible, powerful, and performant version of Prefect yet.
It offers more ways than ever to [model your workflows](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect/releases/tag/3.0.0rc1).
This means that some patterns supported by Prefect 2 are no longer supported with Prefect 3, or are enabled differently.

This guide covers changes that you may need to make to ensure your Prefect 2 workflows keep flowing.

<Info>
Prefect 3 is an upgrade to the open source `prefect` Python package.
The Prefect 3 release does not involve any changes to Prefect Cloud.
All previous and future Prefect 2 releases will continue to work with Prefect Cloud.

## Module location and name changes

Some modules have been renamed, reorganized, or removed for clarity. 
Objects imported from changed modules continue to work until their six month deprecation period ends, but raise deprecation warnings. 

See the [migration script](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect/blob/main/src/prefect/_internal/compatibility/migration.py#L22) for the full list of modules that have been moved or removed.

## Integrations must be upgraded

Integration packages compatible with Prefect 2 generally cannot be used with Prefect 3 and vice versa. 
You must update all of your integration packages when upgrading from Prefect 2 to Prefect 3. 

Specify extras when you install the `prefect` package to ensure that you install the integration package version that corresponds to your Prefect version. For example, use `pip install prefect[aws] --pre` to install Prefect 3 and a compatible `prefect-aws` version.

## Asynchronous task execution behavior

Prefect 2 abstracts away certain task execution concerns, which is often convenient, but sometimes causes unexpected behavior. 
Prefect 3 defaults to running tasks as they would run as normal Python code, and requires you to be more explicit when you modify task execution behavior. 
This results in clearer behavior with fewer surprises.

In Prefect 3, all workflow code, including task functions, runs on the main thread. This means:

- Python code that is not explicitly defined as asynchronous executes synchronously, as normal Python code does.
- Non-threadsafe objects, such as database connections, can be shared globally within a workflow.

<Warning>
In Prefect 3, synchronous tasks and flows **cannot** be called from asynchronous tasks or flows as they could in Prefect 2.
</Warning>

To execute tasks asynchronously, you must either write asynchronous Python functions or use the `Task.submit` method to submit to a Prefect task runner.
Prefect 3 encourages conventional asynchronous Python programming principles. 
Updating your workflows to bring them in line with these principles requires code changes. 
Here are some examples:


<CodeGroup>
```python Prefect 2
@task
async def my_task():
    ...


# Enclosing flow can be sync
@flow
def my_flow():
    return my_task()

    
if __name__ == "__main__":
    my_flow()
```

```python Prefect 3
@task
async def my_task():
    ...


# Enclosing flow must be async as well
@flow
async def my_flow():
    return await my_task()


if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(my_flow())
``` 
</CodeGroup>

Because `Task.submit` is always a synchronous call, it does not need to be awaited. 
`Task.submit` is still non-blocking and execution of the submitted task is also still non-blocking. 

You do not need to use the `await` keyword in front of your `.submit` call:

<CodeGroup>
```python Prefect 2
@task
async def my_task():
    ...


@flow
async def my_flow():
    # Must await `.submit()`
    future = await my_task.submit()
    return future
```

```python Prefect 3
@task
async def my_task():
    ...


@flow
async def my_flow():
    # No need to await `.submit()`
    future = my_task.submit()
    return future
```
</CodeGroup>

The `PrefectFuture` methods are also always synchronous in Prefect 3. Names and return values changed to reflect this:

- `PrefectFuture.get_state()` is now `PrefectFuture.state`
- `PrefectFuture.wait()` now returns `None` instead of a `State`

Wait for the future to complete, then retrieve the state separately:

<CodeGroup>
```python Prefect 2
@task
async def my_task():
    ...


@flow
async def my_flow():
    future = await my_task.submit()
    # State is returned by `wait()`
    state = await future.wait()
    return state
```

```python Prefect 3
@task
async def my_task():
    ...


@flow
async def my_flow():
    future = my_task.submit()
    # Wait for future completion  
    # before retrieving the state
    future.wait()
    state = future.state
    return state
```
</CodeGroup>

If you do not first wait for the future to complete, the run may raise an `AttributeError: coroutine object has no attribute get` exception. 

In Prefect 3, `PrefectFuture`s resulting from submitted task runs are not automatically awaited or resolved before exiting a flow, unless they’re a dependency of other flows or tasks. You must wait for a task’s `PrefectFuture` resolution before the end of a flow:

<CodeGroup>
```python Prefect 2
@task
def my_task():
    ...


@flow
def my_flow():
    # The flow will not exit until 
    # these futures are resolved
    futures = my_task.map([1, 2, 3, 4])
```

```python Prefect 3
@task
def my_task():
    ...


@flow
def my_flow():
    futures = my_task.map([1, 2, 3, 4])
    # You must wait for futures before exiting flow.
    futures.wait()
```
</CodeGroup>

If you do not wait for the futures, the tasks may fail with a `Flow must be running to start a task` error. 
The one exception to this case is that `PrefectFuture`s returned from a flow resolve to states before completing the flow:

```python Prefect 3
@flow
def my_flow():
    # Prefect will resolve these futures to 
    # states because the flow returned them, 
    # so you don't have to call `wait()`.
    return my_task.map([1, 2, 3, 4])
```

## Task caching and result persistence

Prefect 3 supports transactional semantics&mdash;tasks runs can be grouped into larger transactions, enabling more resilient workflows.
In keeping with the transactional model, Prefect 3 encourages task runs to be idempotent&mdash;intended to run only once per flow run.

To support this, Prefect 3 has more eager, intelligent task caching defaults than Prefect 2.
Whenever a task runs, Prefect 3 first computes its cache key, then uses that cache key to evaluate whether that same task has run with the same inputs and as part of the same flow before. 
If it has, the cached result from the previous run is used. If it hasn't, the task runs. 

This means that tasks that may have re-run with the same inputs in Prefect 2 do not re-run in Prefect 3 unless the cache key is modified to be more precise.
The cache key can be configured through the new global `cache_policy` setting, or through the `cache_policy` on a particular task.
If a particular task cannot be made idempotent, you can disable this behavior by setting `cache_policy=NONE` on the task.

Results and cache keys are not stored with your Prefect Cloud account or Prefect server instance. 
They are persisted entirely in your configured result location. 

This caching behavior only takes effect when result persistence is enabled.
The simplest way to enable result persistence is through the Prefect setting `PREFECT_RESULTS_PERSIST_BY_DEFAULT=true`.

See the [caching documentation](/3.0rc/develop/write-tasks#caching) for more information.

## Data validation with Pydantic V2

Prefect 2 uses Pydantic V1 to validate data, particularly for blocks and work pools.

Prefect 3 uses Pydantic V2. This upgrade does not require changes for any built-in Prefect interfaces or supported integrations. 
However, if you have registered custom blocks with a self-hosted Prefect Server, type enforcement for those block schemas must be upgraded to Pydantic V2 to work with Prefect 3. 

See the [Pydantic migration guide](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/migration/) for more information.

## Workers replace agents

A deprecation warning was applied to Prefect interfaces related to agent-based deployments in Prefect’s [2.16.4 release](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect/releases/tag/2.16.4), including infrastructure blocks and `prefect deployment` commands. 
Agents continue to be supported in Prefect 2 until September 2024, but are not included in Prefect 3. 

If you are using agents, learn how to [upgrade from agents to workers](/3.0rc/resources/upgrade-agents-to-workers).

## Variables can be any JSON-compatible type

In Prefect 2, variables are strings. 
To store and retrieve *typed* values in Prefect 2, you have to use certain single-value blocks, including JSON, Date Time, and String blocks.

In Prefect 3, variables can be any JSON-compatible type.
Single-value blocks created in Prefect 2 are still accessible in Prefect 3, but you cannot create new single-value blocks.

See the [set and get variables](/3.0rc/develop/variables) page for more information.
