description: Learn how to use the Prefect CLI for executing shell commands as flows.
---

This page explains how to use the `watch` and `serve` Prefect CLI commands to execute 
and schedule shell commands as Prefect flows, including how to:

- run a shell command as a Prefect flow on-demand with `watch`
- schedule a shell command as a recurring Prefect flow using `serve`

## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have:

- A basic understanding of Prefect flows. Start with the [Getting Started](/3.0rc/get-started/quickstart/) 
guide if necessary.
- A recent version of Prefect installed in your command line environment. 
Follow these [instructions](/3.0rc/get-started/install/) if you have any issues.

## The `watch` command
The `watch` command wraps any shell command in a Prefect flow for instant execution. 
This is ideal for quick tasks or integrating shell scripts into your workflows.

### Example usage
To fetch the current weather in Chicago using the `curl` command, use the following 
Prefect CLI command:

```bash
prefect shell watch "curl http://wttr.in/Chicago?format=3"
```

This command makes a request to `wttr.in`, a console-oriented weather service, and 
prints the weather conditions for Chicago.

### Benefits of `watch`
- **Immediate feedback:** Execute shell commands within the Prefect framework for immediate results.
- **Easy integration:** Blend external scripts or data fetching into your data workflows.
- **Visibility and logging:** Use Prefect's logging to track the execution and output of your 
shell tasks.

## Deploy with `serve`
To run shell commands on a schedule, the `serve` command creates a Prefect 
[deployment](/3.0rc/deploy/infrastructure-examples/docker/) for regular execution. 
This is a quick way to create a deployment served by Prefect.

### Example usage
To set up a daily weather report for Chicago at 9 AM, use the `serve` command as follows:

```bash
prefect shell serve "curl http://wttr.in/Chicago?format=3" --flow-name "Daily Chicago Weather Report" --cron-schedule "0 9 * * *" --deployment-name "Chicago Weather"
```

This command schedules a Prefect flow to fetch Chicago's weather conditions daily, 
providing consistent updates without manual intervention. 
To manually fetch the Chicago weather, create a run of your new deployment from the UI or CLI.

To shut down your server and pause your scheduled runs, hit `ctrl` + `c` in the CLI.

### Benefits of `serve`
- **Automated scheduling:** Schedule shell commands to run automatically, 
ensuring critical updates are generated and available on time.
- **Centralized workflow management:** Manage and monitor your scheduled shell commands 
inside Prefect for a unified workflow overview.
- **Configurable execution:** Customize execution frequency, 
[concurrency limits](/3.0rc/develop/global-concurrency-limits/), 
and other parameters to suit your project's needs and resources.
