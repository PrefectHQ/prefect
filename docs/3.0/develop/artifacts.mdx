title: Create run artifacts
description: Prefect artifacts are persisted outputs designed for human consumption and available in the UI.
---

Prefect artifacts:

- are visually rich annotations on flow and task runs
- are human-readable visual metadata defined in code
- come in standardized formats such as tables, progress indicators, images, Markdown, and links
- are stored in Prefect Cloud or Prefect server and rendered in the Prefect UI
- make it easy to visualize outputs or side effects that your runs produce, and capture updates over time

Common use cases for artifacts include:

- **Progress** indicators: Publish progress indicators for long-running tasks. This helps monitor the progress of your tasks and flows and ensure they are running as expected.
- **Debugging**: Publish data that you care about in the UI to easily see when and where your results were written. If an artifact doesn't look the way you expect, you can find out which flow run last updated it, and you can click through a link in the artifact to a storage location (such as an S3 bucket).
- **Data quality checks**: Publish data quality checks from in-progress tasks to ensure that data quality is maintained throughout a pipeline. Artifacts make for great performance graphs. For example, you can visualize a long-running machine learning model training run. You can also track artifact versions, making it easier to identify changes in your data.
- **Documentation**: Publish documentation and sample data to help you keep track of your work and share information. 
For example, add a description to signify why a piece of data is important.

## Create artifacts

Creating artifacts allows you to publish data from task or flow runs.

There are five artifact types:

- links
- Markdown
- progress
- images
- tables

<Note> 
Each artifact created within a task is displayed individually in the Prefect UI.
This means that each call to `create_link_artifact()` or `create_markdown_artifact()` generates a distinct artifact.

Unlike the Python `print()` function (where you can concatenate multiple calls to include additional items in a report), 
these artifact creation functions must be called multiple times, if necessary. 

To create artifacts such as reports or summaries using `create_markdown_artifact()`, define your message string 
and then pass it to `create_markdown_artifact()` to create the artifact.
</Note>

### Create link artifacts

To create a link artifact, use the `create_link_artifact()` function.
To create multiple versions of the same artifact and/or view them on the Artifacts page of the Prefect UI, 
provide a `key` argument to the `create_link_artifact()` function to track the artifact's history over time.
Without a `key`, the artifact is only visible in the Artifacts tab of the associated flow run or task run.

```python
from prefect import flow, task
from prefect.artifacts import create_link_artifact


@task
def my_first_task():
        create_link_artifact(
            key="irregular-data",
            link="https://nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/my-bucket-name/highly_variable_data.csv",
            description="## Highly variable data",
        )


@task
def my_second_task():
        create_link_artifact(
            key="irregular-data",
            link="https://nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/my-bucket-name/low_pred_data.csv",
            description="# Low prediction accuracy",
        )


@flow
def my_flow():
    my_first_task()
    my_second_task()


if __name__ == "__main__":
    my_flow()
```

<Tip>
**Specify multiple artifacts with the same key for artifact lineage**

You can specify multiple artifacts with the same key to easily track something very specific, such as irregularities in your data pipeline.
</Tip>

After running flows that create artifacts, view the artifacts in the **Artifacts** page of the UI.
Click into the "irregular-data" artifact to see its versions, along with custom descriptions and links to the relevant data.

![Link artifact details with multiple versions](/3.0/img/ui/link-artifact-info.png)

You can also view information about the artifact such as:

- its associated flow run or task run id
- previous and future versions of the artifact (multiple artifacts can have the same key to show lineage) 
- data (in this case a Markdown-rendered link)
- an optional Markdown description
- when the artifact was created or updated

To make the links more readable for you and your collaborators, you can pass a `link_text` argument:

```python
from prefect import flow
from prefect.artifacts import create_link_artifact


@flow
def my_flow():
    create_link_artifact(
        key="my-important-link",
        link="https://www.prefect.io/",
        link_text="Prefect",
    )


if __name__ == "__main__":
    my_flow()
```

In the above example, the `create_link_artifact` method is used within a flow to create a link artifact with a key of `my-important-link`.
The `link` parameter specifies the external resource to link to, and `link_text` specifies the text to display for the link.
Add an optional `description` for context.

### Create progress artifacts

Progress artifacts render dynamically on the flow run graph in the Prefect UI, indicating the progress of long-running tasks. 

To create a progress artifact, use the `create_progress_artifact()` function. To update a progress artifact, use the `update_progress_artifact()` function.

![Progress artifact example](/3.0/img/ui/progress-artifact-example.png)

```python
from time import sleep

from prefect import flow, task
from prefect.artifacts import (
    create_progress_artifact,
    update_progress_artifact,
)


def fetch_batch(i: int):
    # Simulate fetching a batch of data
    sleep(2)


@task
def fetch_in_batches():
    progress_artifact_id = create_progress_artifact(
        progress=0.0,
        description="Indicates the progress of fetching data in batches.",
    )
    for i in range(1, 11):
        fetch_batch(i)
        update_progress_artifact(artifact_id=progress_artifact_id, progress=i * 10)


@flow
def etl():
    fetch_in_batches()


if __name__ == "__main__":
    etl()
```

Progress artifacts are updated with the `update_progress_artifact()` function. Prefect updates a progress artifact in place, rather than versioning it.

### Create Markdown artifacts

To create a Markdown artifact, you can use the `create_markdown_artifact()` function.
To create multiple versions of the same artifact and/or view them on the Artifacts page of the Prefect UI, provide a `key` argument to the `create_markdown_artifact()` function to track an artifact's history over time.
Without a `key`, the artifact is only visible in the Artifacts tab of the associated flow run or task run.

<Warning>
**Don't indent Markdown**

Don't indent Markdown in mult-line strings. Otherwise it will be interpreted incorrectly.
</Warning>

```python
from prefect import flow, task
from prefect.artifacts import create_markdown_artifact


@task
def markdown_task():
    na_revenue = 500000
    markdown_report = f"""# Sales Report

## Summary

In the past quarter, our company saw a significant increase in sales, with a total revenue of $1,000,000. 
This represents a 20% increase over the same period last year.

## Sales by Region

| Region        | Revenue |
|:--------------|-------:|
| North America | ${na_revenue:,} |
| Europe        | $250,000 |
| Asia          | $150,000 |
| South America | $75,000 |
| Africa        | $25,000 |

## Top Products

1. Product A - $300,000 in revenue
2. Product B - $200,000 in revenue
3. Product C - $150,000 in revenue

## Conclusion

Overall, these results are very encouraging and demonstrate the success of our sales team in increasing revenue 
across all regions. However, we still have room for improvement and should focus on further increasing sales in 
the coming quarter.
"""
    create_markdown_artifact(
        key="gtm-report",
        markdown=markdown_report,
        description="Quarterly Sales Report",
    )


@flow()
def my_flow():
    markdown_task()
    

if __name__ == "__main__":
    my_flow()
```

After running the above flow, you should see your "gtm-report" artifact in the Artifacts page of the UI.

![Markdown sales report screenshot](/3.0/img/ui/md-artifact-info.png)

You can view the associated flow run id or task run id, previous versions of the artifact, the rendered Markdown data, and the optional Markdown description.

### Create table artifacts

Create a table artifact by calling `create_table_artifact()`.
To create multiple versions of the same artifact and/or view them on the Artifacts page of the Prefect UI, provide a `key` argument to the `create_table_artifact()` function to track an artifact's history over time.
Without a `key`, the artifact is only visible in the artifacts tab of the associated flow run or task run.

<Note>
The `create_table_artifact()` function accepts a `table` argument. Pass this as a list of lists, a list of dictionaries, or a dictionary of lists.
</Note>

```python
from prefect.artifacts import create_table_artifact


def my_fn():
    highest_churn_possibility = [
       {'customer_id':'12345', 'name': 'John Smith', 'churn_probability': 0.85 }, 
       {'customer_id':'56789', 'name': 'Jane Jones', 'churn_probability': 0.65 } 
    ]

    create_table_artifact(
        key="personalized-reachout",
        table=highest_churn_possibility,
        description= "# Marvin, please reach out to these customers today!"
    )


if __name__ == "__main__":
    my_fn()
```

### Create image artifacts

Image artifacts render publicly available images in the Prefect UI. To create an image artifact, use the `create_image_artifact()` function.

![Image artifact example](/3.0/img/ui/image-artifact-example.png)

```python
from prefect import flow, task
from prefect.artifacts import (
    create_image_artifact,
)


@task
def create_image():
    # Do something to create an image and upload to a url
    image_url = "https://media3.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExZmQydzBjOHQ2M3BhdWJ4M3V1MGtoZGxuNmloeGh6b2dvaHhpaHg0eSZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/3KC2jD2QcBOSc/giphy.gif"
    create_image_artifact(image_url=image_url, description="A gif.", key="gif")
    return image_url


@flow
def my_flow():
    return create_image()


if __name__ == "__main__":
    image_url = my_flow()
    print(f"Image URL: {image_url}")
```

To create an artifact that links to a private image, use the `create_link_artifact()` function instead.

## Manage artifacts

### Reading artifacts

In the Prefect UI, you can view all of the latest versions of your artifacts and click into a specific artifact to see its lineage over time.
Additionally, you can inspect all versions of an artifact with a given key from the CLI by running:

```bash
prefect artifact inspect <my_key>
```

or view all artifacts by running:

```bash
prefect artifact ls
```

You can also use the [Prefect REST API](https://app.prefect.cloud/api/docs#tag/Artifacts/operation/read_artifacts_api_accounts__account_id__workspaces__workspace_id__artifacts_filter_post) 
to programmatically filter your results.

### Fetching artifacts

In Python code, you can retrieve an existing artifact with the `Artifact.get` class method:

```python
from prefect.artifacts import Artifact


my_retrieved_artifact = Artifact.get("my_artifact_key")
```

### Delete artifacts

Delete an artifact in the CLI by providing a key or id:

```bash
prefect artifact delete <my_key>
```

```bash
prefect artifact delete --id <my_id>
```

## Artifacts API

Create, read, or delete artifacts programmatically through the [Prefect REST API](/3.0/api-ref/rest-api/).
With the Artifacts API, you can automate the creation and management of artifacts as part of your workflow.

For example, to read the five most recently created Markdown, table, and link artifacts, you can run the following:

```python fixture:mock_post_200
import requests


PREFECT_API_URL="https://api.prefect.cloud/api/accounts/abc/workspaces/xyz"
PREFECT_API_KEY="pnu_ghijk"
data = {
    "sort": "CREATED_DESC",
    "limit": 5,
    "artifacts": {
        "key": {
            "exists_": True
        }
    }
}

headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {PREFECT_API_KEY}"}
endpoint = f"{PREFECT_API_URL}/artifacts/filter"

response = requests.post(endpoint, headers=headers, json=data)
assert response.status_code == 200
for artifact in response.json():
    print(artifact)
```

If you don't specify a key or that a key must exist, you will also return results, which are a type of key-less artifact.

See the [Prefect REST API documentation](/3.0/api-ref/rest-api/) on artifacts for more information.
