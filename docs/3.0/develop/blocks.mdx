title: Securely store typed configuration
description: Prefect blocks allow you to manage configuration schemas, infrastructure, and secrets for use with deployments or flow scripts.
---

Prefect blocks store typed configuration that can be used across workflows and deployments.
The most common use case for blocks is storing credentials used to access external systems such as AWS or GCP.
Prefect supports [a large number of common blocks](#pre-registered-blocks) and it's also easy to create your own!

<Tip>
**Blocks and parameters**

Blocks are useful for sharing configuration across flow runs and between flows.

For configuration that will change between flow runs, we recommend using [parameters](/3.0/develop/write-flows/#parameters).
</Tip>

## How blocks work

To get the most out of blocks it's important to understand how they work. 

There are three layers to a block: its _type_, a _document_, and a Python _class_. 

### Block type

A block _type_ is essentially a schema registered with the Prefect API. This schema can be inspected and discovered in the UI on the **Blocks** page.

To see block types available for configuration, use `prefect block type ls` 
from the CLI or navigate to the **Blocks** page in the UI and click **+**.

![The block catalogue in the UI](/3.0/img/ui/block-library.png)

These types separate blocks from [Prefect variables](/3.0/develop/variables/), which are unstructured JSON documents.
In addition, block schemas allow for fields of `SecretStr` type which are stored with additional encryption and not displayed by default in the UI.

Block types are identified by a _slug_ that is not configurable.

```python
from prefect.blocks.core import Block


class Cube(Block):
    edge_length_inches: float


# register the block type under the slug 'cube'
Cube.register_type_and_schema()
```

<Note>
Users should rarely need to register types in this way - saving a block document will also automatically register its type.
</Note>

### Block document

A block _document_ is an instantiation of the schema, or block type. A document contains _specific_ values for each field defined in the schema.

All block types allow for the creation of as many documents as you wish. Building on our example above:

```python
from prefect.blocks.core import Block


class Cube(Block):
    edge_length_inches: float


# instantiate the type with specific values
rubiks_cube = Cube(edge_length_inches=2.25)

# store those values in a block document 
# on the server for future use
rubiks_cube.save("rubiks-cube")


# instantiate and save another block document
tiny_cube = Cube(edge_length_inches=0.001)
tiny_cube.save("tiny")
```

Block documents can also be created and updated in the UI or API for easy change management. 
This allows you to work with slowly changing configuration without having to redeploy all workflows that rely on it; for example, you may use this to rotate credentials on a regular basis without touching your deployments.

### Block class

A block _class_ is the primary user-facing object; it is a Python class whose attributes are loaded from a block document. Most Prefect blocks encapsulate additional functionality built on top of the block document. 

For example, an `S3Bucket` block contains methods for downloading data from, or upload data to, an S3 bucket; a `SnowflakeConnector` block contains methods for querying Snowflake databases.

Returning to our `Cube` example from above:

```python
from prefect.blocks.core import Block

class Cube(Block):
    edge_length_inches: float

    def get_volume(self):
        return self.edge_length_inches ** 3

    def get_surface_area(self):
        return 6 * self.edge_length_inches ** 2


rubiks_cube = Cube.load("rubiks-cube")
rubiks_cube.get_volume() # 11.390625
```

<Warning>
The class itself is _not_ stored server-side when registering block types and block documents. 
For this reason, we highly recommend loading block documents by first importing the block class and then calling its `load` method with the relevant document name.
</Warning>

## Using blocks

Using existing or built-in Prefect blocks is as simple as importing the relevant class and calling its `save` and `load` methods.
Note that many Prefect blocks are packaged into one of [Prefect's integration libraries](#blocks-in-prefect-integration-libraries).

To instantiate a block document that stores an S3 bucket value, use the `S3Bucket` block:

```python
from prefect_aws.s3 import S3Bucket

# note that the S3Bucket contains many other fields
bucket_block = S3Bucket(bucket_name="data-bucket")
```

To store this block document for future use, use the `.save()` method:

```python
bucket_block.save(name="my-data-bucket-block")
```

To update a previously saved block document, overwrite the existing document by passing `overwrite=True`:

```python
bucket_block.save(overwrite=True)
```

You can now use the block document name to load the block:

```python
from prefect import flow
from prefect_aws.s3 import S3Bucket

@flow
def what_is_the_bucket():
    bucket = S3Bucket.load("my-data-bucket-block")
    print(bucket.bucket_name)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    what_is_the_bucket() # data-bucket
```

Alternatively, load a block with the unique slug that is a combination of the block type slug and the block name.

To load the `S3Bucket` block from above, run the following:

```python
from prefect_aws.s3 import S3Bucket

s3_block = Block.load("s3-bucket/my_s3_bucket_block")
print(s3_bucket.bucket_name) # data-bucket
```

<Warning>
When using the generic `Block.load` interface for block documents, the Python class that created the type _must_ be importable.
For this reason, we highly recommend loading block documents by first importing the block class and then calling its `load` method with the relevant document name.
</Warning>

You can also delete a block document with the `.delete()` method:

```python
from prefect.blocks.core import Block

Block.delete("s3-bucket/my-data-bucket-block")
```

Alternatively, use the CLI to delete specific blocks with a given slug or id:

```bash
prefect block delete s3-bucket/my-data-bucket-block
```

```bash
prefect block delete --id <my-id>
```

### Nested blocks

Blocks are composable: a block can be used within other blocks.
You can create a block type that uses capabilities from another block type by giving it the appropriate type.

Nested blocks are loosely coupled, and configuration can be changed for each block independently. 
This allows sharing configuration across multiple block documents.

For example, we can expand our basic `S3Bucket` example above using the `AwsCredentials` block:

```python
from prefect_aws import AwsCredentials
from prefect_aws.s3 import S3Bucket

credentials = AwsCredentials(aws_access_key_id="AKIAJKLJKLJKLJKLJKLJK", 
                             aws_secret_access_key="password")
my_bucket_block = S3Bucket(bucket_name="my-bucket", credentials=credentials)
my_bucket_block.save("my_s3_bucket")
```

<Info>
The `aws_secret_access_key` field is typed as `SecretStr`, meaning it will be stored and displayed securely.
</Info>

Alternatively, we can also load previously saved credentials:

```python
my_bucket_block = S3Bucket(
    bucket_name="my-bucket",
    credentials=AwsCredentials.load("my_aws_credentials")
)

my_bucket_block.save("my_s3_bucket")
```

Both of these create a reference from the `AwsCredentials` block document `my_aws_credentials` to the `S3Bucket` block document `my_s3_bucket`, 
so that changes to the values in `my_aws_credentials` propagate to `my_s3_bucket`.

## Create a new block type

To create a custom block type, define a class that subclasses `Block`. The `Block` base class builds 
on Pydantic's `BaseModel`, so you can declare custom fields just like a [Pydantic model](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/usage/models/#basic-model-usage).

We've already seen an example of a `Cube` block that represents a cube and holds information about the length of each edge in inches:

```python
from prefect.blocks.core import Block

class Cube(Block):
    edge_length_inches: float


Cube.register_type_and_schema()
```

### Register custom blocks

In addition to the `register_type_and_schema` method shown above, you can register blocks from a Python module with a CLI command:

```bash
prefect block register --module prefect_aws.credentials
```

This command is useful for registering all blocks found within a module in a [Prefect Integration library](/integrations/).

Alternatively, if a custom block was created in a `.py` file, you can register the block with the CLI command:

```bash
prefect block register --file my_block.py
```

Block documents can now be created with the registered block schema.

### Secret fields

All block values are encrypted before being stored.
If you have values that you would not like visible in the UI or in logs, 
use the `SecretStr` field type provided by Pydantic to automatically obfuscate those values.
You can use this capability for fields that store credentials such as passwords and API tokens.

Here's an example of an `AwsCredentials` block that uses `SecretStr`:

```python
from typing import Optional

from prefect.blocks.core import Block
from pydantic import SecretStr  # if pydantic version >= 2.0, use: from pydantic.v1 import SecretStr

class AwsCredentials(Block):
    aws_access_key_id: Optional[str] = None
    aws_secret_access_key: Optional[SecretStr] = None
    aws_session_token: Optional[str] = None
    profile_name: Optional[str] = None
    region_name: Optional[str] = None
```

Since `aws_secret_access_key` has the `SecretStr` type hint assigned to it, 
the value of that field is not exposed if the object is logged:

```python
aws_credentials_block = AwsCredentials(
    aws_access_key_id="AKIAJKLJKLJKLJKLJKLJK",
    aws_secret_access_key="secret_access_key"
)

print(aws_credentials_block)
# aws_access_key_id='AKIAJKLJKLJKLJKLJKLJK' aws_secret_access_key=SecretStr('**********') aws_session_token=None profile_name=None region_name=None
```

Prefect's `SecretDict` field type allows you to add a dictionary field to your block 
that automatically obfuscates values at all levels in the UI or in logs.
This capability is useful for blocks where typing or structure of secret fields is not known until configuration time.

Here's an example of a block that uses `SecretDict`:

```python
from typing import Dict

from prefect.blocks.core import Block
from prefect.blocks.fields import SecretDict


class SystemConfiguration(Block):
    system_secrets: SecretDict
    system_variables: Dict


system_configuration_block = SystemConfiguration(
    system_secrets={
        "password": "p@ssw0rd",
        "api_token": "token_123456789",
        "private_key": "<private key here>",
    },
    system_variables={
        "self_destruct_countdown_seconds": 60,
        "self_destruct_countdown_stop_time": 7,
    },
)
```

`system_secrets` is obfuscated when `system_configuration_block` is displayed, but `system_variables` show up in plain-text:

```python
print(system_configuration_block)
# SystemConfiguration(
#   system_secrets=SecretDict('{'password': '**********', 'api_token': '**********', 'private_key': '**********'}'), 
#   system_variables={'self_destruct_countdown_seconds': 60, 'self_destruct_countdown_stop_time': 7}
# )
```

### Customize a block's display

You can set metadata fields on a block type's subclass to control how a block displays.

Available metadata fields include:

| Property          | Description                                                                                                                                  |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `_block_type_name` | Display name of the block in the UI. Defaults to the class name.                                                                             |
| `_block_type_slug` | Unique slug used to reference the block type in the API. Defaults to a lowercase, dash-delimited version of the block type name.             |
| `_logo_url`        | URL pointing to an image that should be displayed for the block type in the UI. Default to `None`.                                           |
| `_description`     | Short description of block type. Defaults to docstring, if provided.                                                                         |
| `_code_example`    | Short code snippet shown in UI for how to load/use block type. Defaults to first example provided in the docstring of the class, if provided. |

### Update custom `Block` types

Here's an example of how to add a `bucket_folder` field to your custom `S3Bucket` block; it represents the default path to 
read and write objects from (this field exists on [our implementation](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect-aws/blob/main/prefect_aws/s3.py#L292)).

Add the new field to the class definition:

```python
class S3Bucket(Block):
    bucket_name: str
    credentials: AwsCredentials
    bucket_folder: Optional[str] = None
    ...
```

Then [register the updated block type](#register-blocks) with either your Prefect Cloud account or your self-hosted Prefect server instance.

If you have any existing blocks of this type that were created before the update and 
you'd prefer to not re-create them, migrate them to the new version of your block type by adding the missing values:

```python
# Bypass Pydantic validation to allow your local Block class to load the old block version
my_s3_bucket_block = S3Bucket.load("my-s3-bucket", validate=False)

# Set the new field to an appropriate value
my_s3_bucket_block.bucket_path = "my-default-bucket-path"

# Overwrite the old block values and update the expected fields on the block
my_s3_bucket_block.save("my-s3-bucket", overwrite=True)
```


## Pre-registered blocks

### Built-in blocks

Commonly used block types come built-in with Prefect. 
You can create and use these block types through the UI without installing any additional packages.

| Block                                                                                                                | Slug                                                     | Description                                                                                                                             |

<Warning>
The `S3`, `Azure`, `GCS`, and `GitHub` blocks are deprecated in favor of the corresponding `S3Bucket`, 
`AzureBlobStorageCredentials`, `GCSBucket`, and `GitHubRepository` blocks found in the 
[Prefect integration libraries](/integrations/).
The JSON, DateTime, and String blocks are deprecated in favor of [Variables](/3.0/develop/variables/).
</Warning>

### Blocks in Prefect integration libraries

Some block types that appear in the UI can be created immediately, with the corresponding integration library installed for use.
For example, an AWS Secret block can be created, but not used until the [`prefect-aws` library](/integrations/prefect-aws/) is installed.

Find available block types in many of the published [Prefect integrations libraries](/integrations/).
If a block type is not available in the UI, you can [register it](#register-blocks) through the CLI.

| Block                                                                                                                                                       | Slug                                   | Integration                                                             |
