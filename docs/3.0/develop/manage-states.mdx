description: Prefect states contain information about the status of a flow or task run.
---

States are rich objects that contain information about the status of a particular [task](/3.0/develop/write-tasks)
run or [flow](/3.0/develop/write-flows/) run.

You can learn many things about a task or flow by examining its current state or the
history of its states. For example, a state could tell you that a task:

- is scheduled to make a third run attempt in an hour
- succeeded and what data it produced
- was scheduled to run, but later cancelled
- used the cached result of a previous run instead of re-running
- failed because it timed out

<Note>
**Only runs have states**:
Flows and tasks are templates that describe what a system does;
only when we **run** the system does it also take on a state.
</Note>

## State types

Prefect states have names and types.
A state's name is often, but not always, synonymous with its type. For example, a task run
that is running for the first time has a state with the name Running and the type `RUNNING`. However, if the task retries,
that same task run will have the name Retrying and the type `RUNNING`.

The distinction between types and names is subtle: state _types_ are typically used for backing orchestration logic, whereas state _names_ are more for visual display and bookkeeping.

The full list of states and state types includes:

| Name | Type | Terminal? | Description
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Scheduled` | `SCHEDULED` | No | The run will begin at a particular time in the future. |
| `Late` | `SCHEDULED` | No | The run's scheduled start time has passed, but it has not transitioned to PENDING (15 seconds by default). |
| <span class="no-wrap">`AwaitingRetry`</span> | `SCHEDULED` | No | The run did not complete successfully because of a code issue and had remaining retry attempts. |
| `Pending` | `PENDING` | No | The run has been submitted to execute, but is waiting on necessary preconditions to be satisfied. |
| `Running` | `RUNNING` | No | The run code is currently executing. |
| `Retrying` | `RUNNING` | No | The run code is currently executing after previously not completing successfully. |
| `Paused` | `PAUSED` | No | The run code has stopped executing until it receives manual approval to proceed. |
| `Cancelling` | `CANCELLING` | No | The infrastructure on which the code was running is being cleaned up. |
| `Cancelled` | `CANCELLED` | Yes | The run did not complete because a user determined that it should not. |
| `Completed` | `COMPLETED` | Yes | The run completed successfully. |
| `Cached` | `COMPLETED` | Yes | The run result was loaded from a previously cached value. |
| `RolledBack` | `COMPLETED` | Yes | The run completed successfully but the transaction rolled back and executed rollback hooks. |
| `Failed` | `FAILED` | Yes | The run did not complete because of a code issue and had no remaining retry attempts. |
| `Crashed` | `CRASHED` | Yes | The run did not complete because of an infrastructure issue. |

## Final state determination

The final state of a flow or task run depends on a number of factors; generally speaking there are three categories of terminal states:
- `COMPLETED`: a run in any `COMPLETED` state did not encounter any errors or exceptions and returned successfully
- `FAILED`: a run in any `FAILED` state encountered an error during execution, such as a raised exception
- `CRASHED`: a run in any `CRASHED` state was interrupted by an OS signal such as a `KeyboardInterrupt` or `SIGTERM`

### Task return values

A task will be placed into a `Completed` state if it returns  _any_ Python object, with one exception:
if a task explicitly returns a Prefect `Failed` state, the task will be marked `Failed`.

```python
from prefect import task, flow
from prefect.states import Completed, Failed


@task
def toggle_task(fail: bool):
    if fail:
        return Failed(message="I was instructed to fail.")
    else:
        return Completed(message="I was instructed to succeed.")


@flow
def example():
    # this run will be set to a `Failed` state
    state_one = toggle_task(fail=True)

    # this run will be set to a `Completed` state
    state_two = toggle_task(fail=False)

    # similarly, the flow run will fail because we return a `Failed` state
    return state_one, state_two
```

You can also access state objects directly within a flow through the `return_state` flag:

```python
from prefect import flow, task


@task
def add_one(x):
    return x + 1


@flow
def my_flow():
    result = add_one(1)
    assert isinstance(result, int) and result == 2

    state = add_one(1, return_state=True)
    assert state.is_completed() is True
    assert state.result() == 2
```

<Tip>
Returning a `State` via `return_state=True` is useful when you want to conditionally respond to the terminal states of a task or flow. For example, `if state.is_failed(): ...`.

## Execute code on state changes

State change hooks execute code in response to **_client side_** changes in flow or task run states, enabling you to define actions for
specific state transitions in a workflow.

A state hook must have the following signature:

```python
def my_hook(obj: Task | Flow, run: TaskRun | FlowRun, state: State) -> None:
    ...
```

Both task and flow run hooks can be specified through a keyword argument or through decorator syntax:

```python
from prefect import task, flow

# for type hints only
from prefect import Task
from prefect.context import TaskRun
from prefect.states import State


def first_task_hook(tsk: Task, run: TaskRun, state: State) -> None:
    if not state.name == 'Cached':
        print('I run anytime this task executes successfully')
    else:
        print('and can condition my behavior on details of this run')


@task(log_prints=True, on_completion=[first_task_hook])
def nice_task(name: str):
    print(f"Hello {name}!")


# alternatively hooks can be specified via decorator
@my_nice_task.on_completion
def second_hook(tsk: Task, run: TaskRun, state: State) -> None:
    print('another hook')
```

State change hooks are versatile, allowing you to specify multiple state change hooks for the same state transition,
or to use the same state change hook for different transitions:

```python
def my_success_hook(task, task_run, state):
    print("Task run succeeded!")

def my_failure_hook(task, task_run, state):
    print("Task run failed!")

def my_succeed_or_fail_hook(task, task_run, state):
    print("If the task run succeeds or fails, this hook runs.")

@task(
    on_completion=[my_success_hook, my_succeed_or_fail_hook],
    on_failure=[my_failure_hook, my_succeed_or_fail_hook]
)
```

### Available state change hooks

| Type | Flow | Task | Description |
| ----- | --- | --- | --- |
| `on_completion` | ✓ | ✓ | Executes when a flow or task run enters a `Completed` state. |
| `on_failure` | ✓ | ✓ | Executes when a flow or task run enters a `Failed` state. |
| <span class="no-wrap">`on_cancellation`</span> | ✓ | - | Executes when a flow run enters a `Cancelling` state. |
| `on_crashed` | ✓ | - | Executes when a flow run enters a `Crashed` state. |
| `on_running` | ✓ | - | Executes when a flow run enters a `Running` state. |

<Note>
Note that the `on_rollback` hook for tasks is _not_ a proper state change hook but instead
is a transaction lifecycle hook.
Rollback hooks accept one argument representing the transaction for the task.
</ Note>

### Pass `kwargs` to state change hooks

You can compose the `with_options` method to effectively pass arbitrary `**kwargs` to your hooks:

```python
from functools import partial
from prefect import flow, task

data = {}

def my_hook(task, task_run, state, **kwargs):
    data.update(state=state, **kwargs)

@task
def bad_task():
    raise ValueError("meh")

@flow
def ok_with_failure_flow(x: str = "foo", y: int = 42):
    bad_task_with_a_hook = bad_task.with_options(
        on_failure=[partial(my_hook, **dict(x=x, y=y))]
    )
    # return a tuple of "bar" and the task run state
    # to avoid raising the task's exception
    return "bar", bad_task_with_a_hook(return_state=True)

_, task_run_state = ok_with_failure_flow()

assert data == {"x": "foo", "y": 42, "state": task_run_state}
```

### Example usage: send a notification when a flow run fails

State change hooks enable you to customize messages sent when tasks transition between states, such as sending notifications containing sensitive information when tasks enter a `Failed` state.

Here's an example of running a client-side hook upon a flow run entering a `Failed` state:

```python
from prefect import flow
from prefect.blocks.core import Block
from prefect.settings import PREFECT_API_URL

def notify_slack(flow, flow_run, state):
    slack_webhook_block = Block.load(
        "slack-webhook/my-slack-webhook"
    )

    slack_webhook_block.notify(
        (
            f"Your job {flow_run.name} entered {state.name} "
            f"with message:\n\n"
            f"See <https://{PREFECT_API_URL.value()}/flow-runs/"
            f"flow-run/{flow_run.id}|the flow run in the UI>\n\n"
            f"Tags: {flow_run.tags}\n\n"
            f"Scheduled start: {flow_run.expected_start_time}"
        )
    )

@flow(on_failure=[notify_slack], retries=1)
def failing_flow():
    raise ValueError("oops!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    failing_flow()
```

Note that retries are configured in this example. This means the `on_failure` hook does not run until all `retries` have completed when the flow run enters a `Failed` state.
