description: Learn the different ways to pause, suspend, and resume a flow run.

Prefect allows you to halt a flow run with two functions that are similar, but slightly different.
When a flow run is paused, code execution is stopped and the process continues to run.
When a flow run is suspended, code execution is stopped and so is the process.

### Pause a flow run

Prefect enables pausing an in-progress flow run for manual approval.
Prefect exposes this capability with the [`pause_flow_run`](https://prefect-python-sdk-docs.netlify.app/prefect/engine/#prefect.engine.pause_flow_run)
and [`resume_flow_run`](https://prefect-python-sdk-docs.netlify.app/prefect/engine/#prefect.engine.resume_flow_run) functions.

<Note>
**Timeouts**

Paused flow runs time out after one hour by default.
After the timeout, the flow run fails with a message saying it paused and never resumed.
Specify a different timeout period in seconds using the `timeout` parameter.
</Note>

You can call `pause_flow_run` inside a flow:

```python
from prefect import task, flow, pause_flow_run, resume_flow_run

@task
async def marvin_setup():
    return "a raft of ducks walk into a bar..."


@task
async def marvin_punchline():
    return "it's a wonder none of them ducked!"


@flow
async def inspiring_joke():
    await marvin_setup()
    await pause_flow_run(timeout=600)  # pauses for 10 minutes
    await marvin_punchline()
```

You can also implement conditional pauses:

```python
from prefect import task, flow, pause_flow_run

@task
def task_one():
    for i in range(3):
        sleep(1)
        print(i)

@flow(log_prints=True)
def my_flow():
    terminal_state = task_one.submit(return_state=True)
    if terminal_state.type == StateType.COMPLETED:
        print("Task one succeeded! Pausing flow run..")
        pause_flow_run(timeout=2)
    else:
        print("Task one failed. Skipping pause flow run..")
```

Calling this flow blocks code execution after the first task and waits for resumption to deliver the punchline.

```bash
await inspiring_joke()
> "a raft of ducks walk into a bar..."
```

Resume paused flow runs by clicking **Resume** in the Prefect UI or
calling the `resume_flow_run` utility through client code.

{/* pmd-metadata: notest */}
```python
from prefect import resume_flow_run

resume_flow_run(FLOW_RUN_ID)
```

The paused flow run then finishes.

```
> "it's a wonder none of them ducked!"
```

### Suspend a flow run

Similar to pausing a flow run, Prefect enables suspending an in-progress flow run.

<Note>
**The difference between pausing and suspending a flow run**

There is an important difference between pausing and suspending a flow run.
When you pause a flow run, the flow code is still running but is _blocked_ until someone resumes the flow.
This is not the case with suspending a flow run.
When you suspend a flow run, the flow exits completely and the infrastructure running it (for example, a Kubernetes Job) tears down.
</Note>

This means you can suspend flow runs to save costs instead of paying for long-running infrastructure.
However, when the flow run resumes, the flow code will execute again from the beginning of the flow.
We recommend using [tasks](/3.0/develop/write-tasks/) and [task caching](/3.0/develop/task-caching) to avoid recomputing expensive operations.

Prefect exposes this capability through the [`suspend_flow_run`](https://prefect-python-sdk-docs.netlify.app/prefect/engine/#prefect.engine.suspend_flow_run) and
[`resume_flow_run`](https://prefect-python-sdk-docs.netlify.app/prefect/engine/#prefect.engine.resume_flow_run) functions, as well as the Prefect UI.

When called inside of a flow, `suspend_flow_run` immediately suspends execution of the flow run.
The flow run is marked as `Suspended` and will not resume until `resume_flow_run` is called.

<Note>
**Timeouts**

Suspended flow runs time out after one hour by default.
After the timeout, the flow run fails with a message saying it suspended and never resumed.
You can specify a different timeout period in seconds using the `timeout` parameter or pass `timeout=None` for no timeout.
</Note>

Here is an example of a flow that does not block flow execution while paused.
This flow exits after one task, and is rescheduled upon resuming.
The stored result of the first task is retrieved instead of rerunning.

```python
from prefect import flow, pause_flow_run, task

@task(persist_result=True)
def foo():
    return 42

@flow(persist_result=True)
def noblock_pausing():
    x = foo.submit()
    pause_flow_run(timeout=30, reschedule=True)
    y = foo.submit()
    z = foo(wait_for=[x])
    alpha = foo(wait_for=[y])
    omega = foo(wait_for=[x, y])
```

You can suspend flow runs out-of-process by calling `suspend_flow_run(flow_run_id=<ID>)` or
selecting the **Suspend** button in the Prefect UI or Prefect Cloud.

Resume suspended flow runs can by clicking **Resume** in the Prefect UI or calling the `resume_flow_run` utility through client code.

{/* pmd-metadata: notest */}
```python
from prefect import resume_flow_run

resume_flow_run(FLOW_RUN_ID)
```
<Note>

**You can't suspend subflows independently of their parent run**

If you use a flow to schedule a flow run with `run_deployment`, the
scheduled flow run is linked to the calling flow as a nested flow run by
default. This means you can't suspend the scheduled flow run
independently of the calling flow.

Call `run_deployment` with
`as_subflow=False` to disable this linking if you need to suspend
the scheduled flow run independently of the calling flow.
</Note>

## Waiting for input when pausing or suspending a flow run

<Warning>
**Experimental**

The `wait_for_input` parameter used in the `pause_flow_run` or `suspend_flow_run` functions is an experimental feature.
The interface or behavior of this feature may change without warning in future releases.

If you encounter any issues, please let us know in Slack or with a GitHub issue.
</Warning>

When pausing or suspending a flow run you may want to wait for input from a user.
Prefect provides a way to do this by using the `pause_flow_run` and `suspend_flow_run` functions.
These functions accept a `wait_for_input` argument, which should be a subclass of `prefect.input.RunInput`(a Pydantic model).
When resuming the flow run, users are required to provide data for this model. After successful validation,
the flow run resumes, and the return value of the `pause_flow_run` or `suspend_flow_run`
is an instance of the model containing the provided data.

Here is an example of a flow that pauses and waits for input from a user:

```python
from prefect import flow, pause_flow_run
from prefect.input import RunInput


class UserNameInput(RunInput):
    name: str


@flow(log_prints=True)
async def greet_user():
    user_input = await pause_flow_run(
        wait_for_input=UserNameInput
    )

    print(f"Hello, {user_input.name}!")
```

Running this flow creates a flow run. The flow run advances until code execution reaches `pause_flow_run`,
at which point it moves into a `Paused` state.
Execution blocks and waits for resumption.

When resuming the flow run, users are prompted to provide a value for the `name` field of the `UserNameInput` model.
After successful validation, the flow run resumes, and the return value of the `pause_flow_run`
is an instance of the `UserNameInput` model containing the provided data.

For more information on receiving input from users when pausing and suspending flow runs,
see [Send and receive flow run inputs](/3.0/develop/inputs/).
