title: Limit concurrent task runs with tags
description: Prevent too many tasks from running simultaneously using tags.
---

Task run concurrency limits help prevent too many tasks from running simultaneously.
For example, if many tasks across multiple flows are designed to interact with a database that only allows 10 connections.

Task run concurrency limits use [task tags](#tags). You can specify an optional concurrency limit as the maximum number of concurrent 
task runs in a `Running` state for tasks with a given tag.

<Tip>
Tag-based task concurrency is different from [Global concurrency limits](/3.0/develop/global-concurrency-limits), though they can be used to achieve similar outcomes. Global concurrency limits are a more general way to control concurrency for any Python-based operation, whereas tag-based concurrency limits are specific to Prefect tasks.
</Tip>

If a task has multiple tags, it will run only if **_all_** tags have available concurrency.

Tags without specified concurrency limits are treated as unlimited. Setting a tag's concurrency limit to 0 causes immediate abortion of any task runs with that tag, rather than delaying them.

### Execution behavior

Task tag limits are checked whenever a task run attempts to enter a [`Running` state](/3.0/develop/manage-states/).

If there are no concurrency slots available for any one of your task's tags, it delays the transition to a `Running` state 
and instructs the client to try entering a `Running` state again in 30 seconds 
(or the value specified by the `PREFECT_TASK_RUN_TAG_CONCURRENCY_SLOT_WAIT_SECONDS` setting).

### Configure concurrency limits

<Tip>
**Flow run concurrency limits are set at a work pool, work queue, or deployment level**

While task run concurrency limits are configured through tags (as shown below), [flow run concurrency limits](/3.0/develop/global-concurrency-limits) are configured through work pools and/or work queues.
</Tip>

You can set concurrency limits on as few or as many tags as you wish. You can set limits through:

- Prefect [CLI](#cli)
- Prefect API by using `PrefectClient` [Python client](#python-client)
- Prefect server UI or Prefect Cloud

#### CLI

You can create, list, and remove concurrency limits with Prefect CLI `concurrency-limit` commands.

```bash
prefect concurrency-limit [command] [arguments]
```

| Command | Description                                                      |
| ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| create  | Create a concurrency limit by specifying a tag and limit.        |
| delete  | Delete the concurrency limit set on the specified tag.           |
| inspect | View details about a concurrency limit set on the specified tag. |
| ls      | View all defined concurrency limits.                             |

For example, to set a concurrency limit of 10 on the 'small_instance' tag:

```bash
prefect concurrency-limit create small_instance 10
```

To delete the concurrency limit on the 'small_instance' tag:

```bash
prefect concurrency-limit delete small_instance
```

To view details about the concurrency limit on the 'small_instance' tag:

```bash
prefect concurrency-limit inspect small_instance
```

#### Python client

To update your tag concurrency limits programmatically, use 
[`PrefectClient.orchestration.create_concurrency_limit`](https://prefect-python-sdk-docs.netlify.app//prefect/client/orchestration/#prefect.client.orchestration.PrefectClient.create_concurrency_limit).

`create_concurrency_limit` takes two arguments:

- `tag` specifies the task tag on which you're setting a limit.
- `concurrency_limit` specifies the maximum number of concurrent task runs for that tag.

For example, to set a concurrency limit of 10 on the 'small_instance' tag:

```python
from prefect import get_client

async with get_client() as client:
    # set a concurrency limit of 10 on the 'small_instance' tag
    limit_id = await client.create_concurrency_limit(
        tag="small_instance", 
        concurrency_limit=10
        )
```

To remove all concurrency limits on a tag, use [`PrefectClient.delete_concurrency_limit_by_tag`](https://prefect-python-sdk-docs.netlify.app/prefect/client/orchestration/#prefect.client.orchestration.PrefectClient.delete_concurrency_limit_by_tag/), passing the tag:

```python
async with get_client() as client:
    # remove a concurrency limit on the 'small_instance' tag
    await client.delete_concurrency_limit_by_tag(tag="small_instance")
```

If you wish to query for the current limit on a tag, use [`PrefectClient.read_concurrency_limit_by_tag`](https://prefect-python-sdk-docs.netlify.app/prefect/client/orchestration/#prefect.client.orchestration.PrefectClient.read_concurrency_limit_by_tag), passing the tag:

To see _all_ of your limits across all of your tags, use [`PrefectClient.read_concurrency_limits`](https://prefect-python-sdk-docs.netlify.app/prefect/client/orchestration/#prefect.client.orchestration.PrefectClient.read_concurrency_limits).

```python
async with get_client() as client:
    # query the concurrency limit on the 'small_instance' tag
    limit = await client.read_concurrency_limit_by_tag(tag="small_instance")
```
