title: Write transactions
description: Learn how transactional semantics help you minimize the cost of failure and add idempotency to your workflows.
---

Prefect supports _transactional semantics_ in your workflows that allow you to rollback on task failure
and configure groups of tasks that run as an atomic unit.

A _transaction_ in Prefect corresponds to a job that needs to be done.
A transaction runs at most one time, and produces a result record upon completion at a unique address
specified by a dynamically computed cache key.
These records can be shared across tasks and flows.

Under the hood, every Prefect task run is governed by a transaction.
In the default mode of task execution, all you need to understand about transactions are [the policies
determining the task's cache key computation](/3.0/develop/task-caching).

<Tip>
**Transactions and states**

Transactions and states are similar but different in important ways.
Transactions determine whether a task should or should not execute, whereas states enable visibility into
code execution status.
</Tip>


## Write your first transaction

Tasks can be grouped into a common transaction using the `transaction` context manager:

```python
import os
from time import sleep

from prefect import task, flow
from prefect.transactions import transaction


@task
def write_file(contents: str):
    "Writes to a file."
    with open("side-effect.txt", "w") as f:
        f.write(contents)


@write_file.on_rollback
def del_file(transaction):
    "Deletes file."
    os.unlink("side-effect.txt")


@task
def quality_test():
    "Checks contents of file."
    with open("side-effect.txt", "r") as f:
        data = f.readlines()

    if len(data) < 2:
        raise ValueError("Not enough data!")


@flow
def pipeline(contents: str):
    with transaction():
        write_file(contents)
        sleep(2) # sleeping to give you a chance to see the file
        quality_test()


if __name__ == "__main__":
    pipeline(contents="hello world")
```

If you run this flow `pipeline(contents="hello world!")` it will fail.
Importantly, after the flow has exited, there is no `"side-effect.txt"` file in
your working directory.
This is because the `write_file` task's `on_rollback` hook was executed due to the transaction failing.

<Tip>
**`on_rollback` hooks are different than `on_failure` hooks**

Note that the `on_rollback` hook is executed when the `quality_test` task fails, not the `write_file`
task that it is associated with it, which succeeded.
This is because rollbacks occur whenever the transaction a task is participating in fails, even if that
failure is outside the task's local scope.
This behavior makes transactions a valuable pattern for managing pipeline failure.
</Tip>

## Transaction lifecycle

Every transaction goes through at most four lifecycle stages:

- **BEGIN**: in this phase, the transaction's key is computed and looked up. If a record already exists at
the key location the transaction considers itself committed.
- **STAGE**: in this phase, the transaction stages a piece of data to be committed to its result location.
Whether this data is committed or rolled back depends on the commit mode of the transaction.
- **ROLLBACK**: if the transaction encounters _any_ error **after** staging, it rolls itself back and does
not proceed to commit anything.
- **COMMIT**: in this final phase, the transaction writes its record to its configured location. At this point
the transaction is complete.

It is important to note that rollbacks only occur _after_ the transaction has been staged.
Revisiting our example from above, there are actually _three_ transactions at play:
- the larger transaction that begins when `with transaction()` is executed; this transaction remains active
throughout the duration of the subtransactions within it.
- the transaction associated with the `write_file` task. Upon completion of the `write_file` task, this
transaction is now **STAGED**.
- the transaction associated with the `quality_test` task. This transaction fails before it can be staged,
causing a rollback in its parent transaction which then rolls back any staged subtransactions. In particular,
the staged `write_file`'s transaction is rolled back.

<Tip>
**Tasks also have `on_commit` lifecycle hooks**

In addition to the `on_rollback` hook, a task can also register `on_commit` hooks that execute whenever
its transaction is committed.
A task run persists its result only at transaction commit time, which could be significantly
after the task's completion time if it is within a long running transaction.

The signature for an `on_commit` hook is the same as that of an `on_rollback` hook:

{/* pmd-metadata: continuation */}
```python
@write_file.on_commit
def confirmation(transaction):
    print("committing a record now using the task's cache key!")
```
</Tip>

## Idempotency

You can ensure sections of code are functionally idempotent by wrapping them in a transaction. By specifying a `key` for your transaction, you can ensure that 
your code is executed only once.

For example, here's a flow that downloads some data from an API and writes it to a file:

```python
from prefect import task, flow
from prefect.transactions import transaction


@task
def download_data():
    """Imagine this downloads some data from an API"""
    return "some data"


@task
def write_data(data: str):
    """This writes the data to a file"""
    with open("data.txt", "w") as f:
        f.write(data)


@flow(log_prints=True)
def pipeline():
    with transaction(key="download-and-write-data") as txn:
        if txn.is_committed():
            print("Data file has already been written. Exiting early.")
            return
        data = download_data()
        write_data(data)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    pipeline()
```

If you run this flow, it will write data to a file the first time, but it will exit early on subsequent runs because the transaction has already been committed.

Giving the transaction a `key` will cause the transaction to write a record on commit signifying that the transaction has completed.
The call to `txn.is_committed()` will return `True` only if the persisted record exists.

### Handling race conditions

Persisting transaction records works well to ensure sequential executions are idempotent, but what about when about when multiple transactions with the same key run at
the same time?

By default, transactions have an isolation level of `READ_COMMITED` which means that they can see any previously committed records, but they are not prevented from overwriting
a record that was created by another transaction between the time they started and the time they committed.

To see this behavior in action in the following script:

```python
import threading

from prefect import flow, task
from prefect.transactions import transaction


@task
def download_data():
    return f"{threading.current_thread().name} is the winner!"


@task
def write_file(contents: str):
    "Writes to a file."
    with open("race-condition.txt", "w") as f:
        f.write(contents)


@flow
def pipeline(transaction_key: str):
    with transaction(key=transaction_key) as txn:
        if txn.is_committed():
            print("Data file has already been written. Exiting early.")
            return
        data = download_data()
        write_file(data)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Run the pipeline twice to see the race condition
    transaction_key = f"race-condition-{uuid.uuid4()}"
    thread_1 = threading.Thread(target=pipeline, name="Thread 1", args=(transaction_key,))
    thread_2 = threading.Thread(target=pipeline, name="Thread 2", args=(transaction_key,))

    thread_1.start()
    thread_2.start()

    thread_1.join()
    thread_2.join()
```
    
If you run this script, you will see that sometimes "Thread 1 is the winner!" is written to the file and sometimes "Thread 2 is the winner!" is written 
**even though the transactions have the same key**. You can ensure subsequent runs don't exit early by changing the `key` argument between runs.

To prevent race conditions, you can set the `isolation_level` of a transaction to `SERIALIZABLE`. This will cause each transaction to take a lock on the 
provided key. This will prevent other transactions from starting until the first transaction has completed.

Here's an updated example that uses `SERIALIZABLE` isolation:

```python
import threading
import uuid
from prefect import flow, task
from prefect.locking.filesystem import FileSystemLockManager
from prefect.results import ResultStore
from prefect.settings import PREFECT_HOME
from prefect.transactions import IsolationLevel, transaction


@task
def download_data():
    return f"{threading.current_thread().name} is the winner!"


@task
def write_file(contents: str):
    "Writes to a file."
    with open("race-condition.txt", "w") as f:
        f.write(contents)


@flow
def pipeline(transaction_key: str):
    with transaction(
        key=transaction_key,
        isolation_level=IsolationLevel.SERIALIZABLE,
        store=ResultStore(
            lock_manager=FileSystemLockManager(
                lock_files_directory=PREFECT_HOME.value() / "locks"
            )
        ),
    ) as txn:
        if txn.is_committed():
            print("Data file has already been written. Exiting early.")
            return
        data = download_data()
        write_file(data)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    transaction_key = f"race-condition-{uuid.uuid4()}"
    thread_1 = threading.Thread(target=pipeline, name="Thread 1", args=(transaction_key,))
    thread_2 = threading.Thread(target=pipeline, name="Thread 2", args=(transaction_key,))

    thread_1.start()
    thread_2.start()

    thread_1.join()
    thread_2.join()
```

To use a transaction with the `SERIALIZABLE` isolation level, you must also provide a `lock_manager` to the `transaction` context manager. The 
lock manager is responsible for acquiring and releasing locks on the transaction key. In the example above, we use a `FileSystemLockManager` which 
will manage locks as files on the current instance's filesystem.

Prefect offers several lock managers for different concurrency use cases:

| Lock Manager | Storage | Supports | Module/Package |
|--------------|---------|----------------|--------------|
| `MemoryLockManager` | In-memory | Single-process workflows using threads | `prefect.locking.memory` |
| `FileLockManager` | Filesystem | Multi-process workflows on a single machine | `prefect.locking.filesystem` |
| `RedisLockManager` | Redis database | Distributed workflows | `prefect-redis` |

## Access data within transactions

Key-value pairs can be set within a transaction and accessed elsewhere within the transaction, including within the `on_rollback` hook.

The code below shows how to set a key-value pair within a transaction and access it within the `on_rollback` hook:

```python
import os
from time import sleep

from prefect import task, flow
from prefect.transactions import transaction


@task
def write_file(filename: str, contents: str):
    "Writes to a file."
    with open(filename, "w") as f:
        f.write(contents)


@write_file.on_rollback
def del_file(txn):
    "Deletes file."
    os.unlink(txn.get("filename"))


@task
def quality_test(filename):
    "Checks contents of file."
    with open(filename, "r") as f:
        data = f.readlines()

    if len(data) < 2:
        raise ValueError(f"Not enough data!")


@flow
def pipeline(filename: str, contents: str):
    with transaction() as txn:
        txn.set("filename", filename)
        write_file(filename, contents)
        sleep(2)  # sleeping to give you a chance to see the file
        quality_test(filename)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    pipeline(
        filename="side-effect.txt",
        contents="hello world",
    )
```

The value of `contents` is accessible within the `on_rollback` hook.

Use `get_transaction()` to access the transaction object and `txn.get("key")` to access the value of the key.
