Prefect is an orchestration and observability platform that empowers developers to build and scale workflows quickly.
In this quickstart, you will use Prefect to convert the following Python script to a deployable workflow:

```python my_script.py
import httpx

def show_stars(github_repo: str):
    """Show the number of stars that a repository has"""

    # Fetch repository statistics from GitHub
    repo_stats = httpx.get(f"https://api.github.com/repos/{github_repo}").json()

    # Print the number of stars
    print(f"Stars ðŸŒ  : {repo_stats['stargazers_count']}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    show_stars("PrefectHQ/prefect")
```

## Install Prefect

<Installation />

<Tip>
See [Install Prefect](/3.0/get-started/install/) for more details on installation.

## Connect to a Prefect API

Connect to a Prefect API:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Self-hosted">
1. Start a local API server:

   ```bash
   prefect server start
   ```

1. Open the Prefect dashboard in your browser at [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200).
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Prefect Cloud">
1. Head to [https://app.prefect.cloud/](https://app.prefect.cloud/) and sign in or create a forever-free Prefect Cloud account.
1. Log in to Prefect Cloud from your development environment:

   ```bash
   prefect cloud login
   ```

1. Choose **Log in with a web browser** and click the **Authorize** button in the browser window that opens.

Your CLI is now authenticated with your Prefect Cloud account through a locally stored API key that expires in 30 days.

If you have any issues with browser-based authentication, you can [authenticate with a manually created API key](/3.0/manage/cloud/manage-users/api-keys/) instead.
  </Tab>

## Convert your script to a Prefect workflow

The easiest way to convert a Python script into a workflow is to add a `@flow` decorator to the script's entrypoint.
This will create a corresponding [flow](/3.0/develop/write-flows/). 

Adding `@task` decorators to any functions called by the flow converts them to [tasks](/3.0/develop/write-tasks/). 
Tasks receive metadata about upstream dependencies and the state of those dependencies before they run.
Prefect will then record these dependencies and states as it orchestrates these tasks.

```python my_workflow.py
import httpx
from prefect import flow, task # Prefect flow and task decorators

@flow(log_prints=True)
def show_stars(github_repo: str):
    """Flow: Show the number of stars that a GitHub repo has"""

    # Call Task 1
    repo_stats = fetch_stats(github_repo)

    # Call Task 2
    stars = get_stars(repo_stats)

    # Print the result
    print(f"Stars ðŸŒ  : {stars}")

@task
def fetch_stats(github_repo: str):
    """Task 1: Fetch the statistics for a GitHub repo"""

    return httpx.get(f"https://api.github.com/repos/{github_repo}").json()

@task
def get_stars(repo_stats: dict):
    """Task 2: Get the number of stars from GitHub repo statistics"""

    return repo_stats['stargazers_count']

# Run the flow
if __name__ == "__main__":
    show_stars("PrefectHQ/prefect")
```

<Note>
The `log_prints=True` argument provided to the `@flow` decorator automatically converts any `print` statements within the function to `INFO` level logs.
</Note>

## Run your flow

You can run your Prefect flow just as you would a Python script:

```bash
python my_workflow.py
```

Prefect automatically tracks the state of the flow run and logs the output, which can be viewed directly in the terminal or in the UI.

## Next steps

In this tutorial, you successfully converted a Python script to a deployable workflow tracked by Prefect.

Next, get this workflow off of your laptop and [run it automatically on a schedule](/3.0/tutorials/schedule).
