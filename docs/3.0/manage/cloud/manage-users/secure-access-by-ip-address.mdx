title: Secure access by IP address
description: Manage network access to Prefect Cloud accounts with IP Allowlists.

IP allowlisting is an available upgrade to certain Enterprise plans. 
IP allowlisting enables account administrators to restrict access to Prefect Cloud APIs and the UI at the network level. 
To learn more, please contact your account manager or the Prefect team at sales@prefect.io.

Once the feature has been enabled for your team's Enterprise account, use the Prefect CLI to add an IP address to the allowlist:

<Note>To help prevent accidental account lockouts, an update to an allowlist requires the requestor's current IP address to be on the list.</Note>

```bash
prefect cloud ip-allowlist add <your-ip-address> --description "My home IP address"
```

The allowlist has a limit of 25 entries; 
however in addition to individual IP addresses, a range of IP addresses can be added as a single entry using CIDR notation:

```bash
prefect cloud ip-allowlist add "192.168.1.0/24" -d "A CIDR block containing 256 IP addresses from 192.168.1.0 to 192.168.1.255"
```

Next, enable the allowlist for your account to start enforcing the restrictions:

```bash
prefect cloud ip-allowlist enable
```

Individual entries can also be toggled on or off:
    
```bash
prefect cloud ip-allowlist toggle <ip-address>
```

Once turned on with at least one enabled IP entry, the allowlist will be enforced for all incoming requests to Prefect Cloud from the UI and API.

For other related commands, see the CLI help documentation with:
    
```bash
prefect cloud ip-allowlist --help
```
