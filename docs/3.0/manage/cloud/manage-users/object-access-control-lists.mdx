title: Object Access Control Lists
description: Restrict block and deployment access to individual actors within a workspace. 
---

Prefect Cloud's [Enterprise plan](https://www.prefect.io/pricing) offers object-level access control lists (ACLs) to restrict access to 
specific users and service accounts within a workspace. ACLs are supported for blocks and deployments.

Organization Admins and Workspace Owners can configure access control lists by navigating to an object and clicking **manage access**.
When an ACL is added, all users and service accounts with access to an object through their workspace role will lose access if not 
explicitly added to the ACL.

<Note>
**ACLs and visibility**

Objects not governed by access control lists such as flow runs, flows, and artifacts are visible to a user within a 
workspace even if an associated block or deployment has been restricted for that user.
</Note>

See the [Prefect Cloud plans](https://www.prefect.io/pricing) to learn more about options for supporting object-level access control.
