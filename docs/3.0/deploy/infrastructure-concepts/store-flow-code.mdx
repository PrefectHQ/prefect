title: Retrieve code from storage
description: Learn about where to store your flow code.
---

When a deployment runs, the execution environment needs access to the flow code.
Flow code is not stored in Prefect server or Prefect Cloud.

You have several flow code storage options for remote execution:
1. Git-based storage (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket)
2. Docker image-based storage
3. Cloud-provider storage (AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, GCP GCS)

Local storage is also an option for local deployments.

For the examples below we show how to create a work pool-based deployment for each of these storage options.

## Git-based storage

Git-based version control platforms provide redundancy, version control, and collaboration capabilities. Prefect supports:

- [GitHub](https://github.com/)
- [GitLab](https://www.gitlab.com)
- [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/)



To create a deployment with git-based storage:

1. Run `prefect deploy` from the root directory of the git repository.
1. You will see a series of prompts. 
    1. Select the flow to use.
    1. Name your deployment.
    1. Add a schedule if desired.
    1. Select the work pool to use.
    1. If using a Docker-based work pool, you will be asked if you would like to build a Docker image. 
       Enter **n**, as we will use a remote repository in this example.
    1. You will be asked if you would like to have your code pulled from a remote storage location when running the flow. Enter **y**.
    1. Select **Git Repo** for the Storage Type.
    
Prefect detects that you are in a git repository and confirms the URL to pull your flow code from as in the example below:

```bash
? Is https://github.com/my_username/my_repo.git the correct URL to pull your flow code from? [y/n] (y): 
? Is main the correct branch to pull your flow code from? [y/n] (y): 
? Is this a private repository? [y/n]: y
```

In this example, the git repository is hosted on GitHub.
If you are using Bitbucket or GitLab, the URL will match your provider.
If the repository is public, enter **n** for the private repository prompt.

If the repository is private, you can enter a token to access your private repository. 
The token is saved to an encrypted [Prefect Secret block](/3.0/develop/blocks).

```bash
? Please enter a token that can be used to access your private repository. 
This token will be saved as a secret via the Prefect API: "123_abc_this_is_my_token"
```

Verify that you have a new Secret block in your active workspace named in the format 
"deployment-my-deployment-my-flow-name-repo-token".

The process for creating access tokens differs for each provider.

    We recommend using HTTPS with [fine-grained Personal Access Tokens](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-fine-grained-personal-access-token) 
    to limit access by repository. 
    See the GitHub docs for [Personal Access Tokens (PATs)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token).

    Under *Your Profile -> Developer Settings -> Personal access tokens -> Fine-grained token* choose *Generate New Token* and 
    fill in the required fields. 
    Under *Repository access* choose *Only select repositories* and grant the token permissions for *Contents*.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Bitbucket">

    We recommend using HTTPS with Repository, Project, or Workspace [Access Tokens](https://support.atlassian.com/bitbucket-cloud/docs/access-tokens/). 
    
    You can create a Repository Access Token with Scopes -> Repositories -> Read.

    Bitbucket requires you prepend the token string with `x-token-auth:` The full string looks like 
    `x-token-auth:abc_123_this_is_a_token`.

  <Tab title="GitLab">

    We recommend using HTTPS with [Project Access Tokens](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/profile/personal_access_tokens.html).

    In your repository in the GitLab UI, select *Settings -> Repository -> Project Access Tokens* and check 
    *read_repository* under *Select scopes*.
  </Tab>

To configure a Secret block ahead of time, create the block in code or the Prefect UI and 
reference it in your `prefect.yaml` file `pull` step or your Python `deploy` method.

<CodeGroup>

```python
from prefect import flow
from prefect.runner.storage import GitRepository
from prefect.blocks.system import Secret


if __name__ == "__main__":
    flow.from_source(
        source=GitRepository(
            url="https://github.com/org/my-private-repo.git",
            credentials=Secret.load("my-secret-block-with-my-gh-credentials")
        ),
        entrypoint="my_file.py:my_flow",
    ).deploy(
        name="private-github-deploy",
        work_pool_name="my_pool",
    )
```

```yaml prefect.yaml

pull:
    - prefect.deployments.steps.git_clone:
        repository: https://gitlab.com/org/my-private-repo.git
        access_token: "{{ prefect.blocks.secret.my-block-name }}"
```
</CodeGroup>

Alternatively, instead of creating a Secret block, you can create a Credentials block ahead of time and reference it in the `prefect.yaml` pull step or your Python `deploy` method.

    ```
    </CodeGroup>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Warning>
**Push your code**

When you make a change to your code, Prefect does not push your code to your git-based version control platform.
You need to push your code manually or as part of your CI/CD pipeline.
This is intentional to avoid confusion about the git history and push process.
</Warning>

## Docker-based storage

Another popular way to store your flow code is to include it in a Docker image. 
All work pool options except **Process** and **Prefect Managed** allow you to bake your code into a Docker image.

If a requirements.txt file is present in the directory, it will be discovered and packages will be installed into the image with pip.

To create a deployment with Docker-based storage:

<CodeGroup>

```python my_docker_deploy.py
from prefect import flow

@flow
def my_flow():
    print("Hello from inside a Docker container!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    my_flow.deploy(
        name="docker-deploy",
        work_pool_name="my_pool",
        image="my-docker-image:latest",
    )
```

```yaml prefect.yaml

push:
    - prefect.deployments.steps.docker_build:
        image: my-docker-image:latest

```
</CodeGroup>

To generate a `prefect.yaml` file interactively in the CLI, run `prefect deploy` and choose to store the flow code in a Docker image. 

<Tip>
**CI/CD may not require push or pull steps**

You don't need push or pull steps in the `prefect.yaml` file if using CI/CD to build a Docker image outside of Prefect.
Instead, the work pool can reference the image directly.
</Tip>

## Cloud-provider storage

You can store your code in an AWS S3 bucket, Azure Blob Storage container, or GCP GCS bucket and specify the destination 
directly in the `push` and `pull` steps of your `prefect.yaml` file.

To create a templated `prefect.yaml` file through the CLI run the interactive `prefect deploy` command and select the relevant cloud-provider storage.
Below are the relevant portions of the `prefect.yaml` file.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="AWS S3 bucket">

    

    <CodeGroup>

    ```python my_s3_deploy.py
    from prefect import flow
    from 


    if __name__ == "__main__":
        flow.from_source(
            source=S3(
                bucket="my-bucket",
                folder="my-folder",
                credentials=aw
            ),
            entrypoint="my_file.py:my_flow",
        ).deploy(
            name="my-deployment",
    ```

    ```yaml prefect.yaml

    # push section allows you to manage if and how this project is uploaded to remote locations
    push:
    - prefect_aws.deployments.steps.push_to_s3:
        id: push_code
        requires: prefect-aws>=0.5
        bucket: my-bucket
        folder: my-folder
        credentials: "{{ prefect.blocks.aws-credentials.my-credentials-block }}" # if private

    # pull section allows you to provide instructions for cloning this project in remote locations
    pull:
    - prefect_aws.deployments.steps.pull_from_s3:
        id: pull_code
        requires: prefect-aws>=0.5
        bucket: '{{ push_code.bucket }}'
        folder: '{{ push_code.folder }}'
        credentials: "{{ prefect.blocks.aws-credentials.my-credentials-block }}" # if private 
    ``` 

    </CodeGroup>

    If the bucket requires authentication to access it, you can do the following:

    1. Install the [Prefect-AWS](https://prefecthq.github.io/prefect-aws/) library with `pip install -U prefect-aws`
    1. Register the blocks in Prefect-AWS with `prefect block register -m prefect_aws` 
    1. Create a user with a role with read and write permissions to access the bucket. If using the UI, create an access 
    key pair with *IAM -> Users -> Security credentials -> Access keys -> Create access key*. Choose *Use case -> Other* and then copy the *Access key* and *Secret access key* values.
    1. Create an AWS Credentials block in code or the Prefect UI. In addition to the block name, most users will fill 
    in the *AWS Access Key ID* and *AWS Access Key Secret* fields.
    1. Reference the block as shown in the push and pull steps

    If the blob storage requires authentication to access it, follow these steps:

    1. Install the [prefect-azure](/integrations/prefect-azure/) library with `pip install -U prefect-azure`
    1. Register the blocks in prefect-azure with `prefect block register -m prefect_azure` 
    1. Create an access key for a role with sufficient (read and write) permissions to access the blob. 
    You can create a connection string containing all required information in the UI under *Storage Account -> Access keys*.
    1. Create an Azure Blob Storage Credentials block in code or the Prefect UI. Enter a name for the block and paste the 
    connection string into the *Connection String* field.
    1. Reference the block as shown in the push and pull steps above.

  <Tab title="GCP GCS bucket">

    Choose `GCS` as the recipe and enter the bucket name when prompted.

    <CodeGroup>

    ```python my_gcs_deploy.py

    from prefect import flow
    from prefect_gcp import GCSBucketCredentials


    if __name__ == "__main__":
        flow.from_source(
            source=GCSBucket(
                bucket="my-bucket",
                folder="my-folder",
                credentials=GCSBucketCredentials.load("my-credentials-block")
            ),
            entrypoint="my_file.py:my_flow",
        ).deploy(
            name="my-deployment",
            work_pool_name="my_pool"
        )
    ```

    ```yaml prefect.yaml

    # push section allows you to manage if and how this project is uploaded to remote locations
    push:
    - prefect_gcp.deployment.steps.push_to_gcs:
        id: push_code
        requires: prefect-gcp>=0.6
        bucket: my-bucket
        folder: my-folder
        credentials: "{{ prefect.blocks.gcp-credentials.my-credentials-block }}" # if private

    If the bucket requires authentication to access it, follow these steps:

    1. Install the [Prefect-GCP](/integrations/prefect-gcp/) library with `pip install -U prefect-gcp`
    1. Register the blocks in Prefect-GCP with `prefect block register -m prefect_gcp` 
    1. Create a service account in GCP for a role with read and write permissions to access the bucket contents. 
    If using the GCP console, go to *IAM & Admin -> Service accounts -> Create service account*. 
    After choosing a role with the required permissions, 
    see your service account and click on the three dot menu in the *Actions* column. 
    Select *Manage Keys -> ADD KEY -> Create new key -> JSON*. Download the JSON file.
    1. Create a GCP Credentials block in code or the Prefect UI. Enter a name for the block and paste the entire contents of the JSON key file into the *Service Account Info* field.
    1. Reference the block as shown in the push and pull steps above.
    </Tab>
</Tabs>

Another authentication option is to give the [worker](/3.0/deploy/infrastructure-concepts/workers/) access 
to the storage location at runtime through SSH keys.

Alternatively, you can inject environment variables into your deployment. 
See this example that uses an environment variable named `CUSTOM_FOLDER`:

```yaml

 push:
    - prefect_gcp.deployment.steps.push_to_gcs:
        id: push_code
        requires: prefect-gcp>=0.6
        bucket: my-bucket
        folder: '{{ $CUSTOM_FOLDER }}'
```

## Store code locally

If you are using a Process work pool, you can store your flow code in a localfolder.

<CodeGroup>

```python
from prefect import flow
from pathlib import Path


@flow(log_prints=True)
def my_flow(name: str = "World"):
    print(f"Hello {name}!")
    print(str(Path(__file__).parent))  # dynamic path


if __name__ == "__main__":
    my_flow.from_source(
        source=str(Path(__file__).parent),  # code stored in local directory
        entrypoint="local_process_deploy_local_code.py:my_flow",
    ).deploy(
        name="local-process-deploy-local-code",
        work_pool_name="process-pool",
    )
```

```yaml prefect.yaml  # TK try

pull:
    - prefect.deployments.steps.local_file_copy:
        source: /path/to/destination
        destination: ./my_folder
```
</CodeGroup>

## Include or exclude files from storage

By default, Prefect includes all files in the current folder when you create a deployment.

When using a git repository, Docker image, or cloud-provider storage location, you may want to exclude certain files or directories. If you are familiar with Docker you are likely familiar with the [`.dockerignore`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#dockerignore-file) file. For cloud-provider storage, the `.prefectignore` file serves the same purpose and follows a similar syntax as those files. So an entry of `*.pyc` will exclude all `.pyc` files from upload.






TK from here down was just taken from the docker page and needs integrated.

The `entrypoint` is the path to the file the flow is located in and the function name, separated by a colon.

Alternatively, you could specify a git-based cloud storage URL for a Bitbucket or GitLab repository.

<Note>
    If you don't specify an image as part of your deployment creation, the image specified in the work pool
    runs your flow.
</Note>

After creating a deployment, you may need to change your flow code.
Generally, you can just push your code to GitHub, without rebuilding your deployment.
The exception is if there is something the server needs to know about changes, such as the flow entrypoint parameters.
Rerunning the Python script with `.deploy` updates your deployment on the server with the new flow code.

If you need to provide additional configuration, such as specifying a private repository, you can provide a
[`GitRepository`](https://prefect-python-sdk-docs.netlify.app/prefect/flows/#prefect.runner.storage.GitRepository) object instead of a URL:

```python private_git_storage.py
from prefect import flow
from prefect.runner.storage import GitRepository
from prefect.blocks.system import Secret

if __name__ == "__main__":
    flow.from_source(
        source=GitRepository(
            url="https://github.com/org/private-repo.git",
            branch="dev",
            credentials={
                "access_token": Secret.load("github-access-token")
            }
        ),
        entrypoint="flows/no-image.py:hello_world",
    ).deploy(
        name="private-git-storage-deployment",
        work_pool_name="my-docker-pool",
        build=False
    )
```

Note the use of the Secret block to load the GitHub access token.
Alternatively, you could provide a username and password to the `username` and `password` fields of the `credentials` argument.

### Store your code in cloud provider storage

Another option for flow code storage is any [fsspec](https://filesystem-spec.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)-supported
storage location, such as AWS S3, GCP GCS, or Azure Blob Storage.

For example, you can pass the S3 bucket path to `source`.

```python s3_storage.py
from prefect import flow


if __name__ == "__main__":
    flow.from_source(
        source="s3://my-bucket/my-folder",
        entrypoint="flows.py:my_flow",
    ).deploy(
        name="deployment-from-aws-flow",
        work_pool_name="my-docker-pool",
    )
```

In the example above, your credentials are auto-discovered from your deployment creation environment. Your credentials
must be available in your runtime environment.

If you need additional configuration for your cloud-based storage (for example, with a private S3 Bucket), we recommend using a
[storage block](/3.0/develop/blocks/).
A storage block also ensures your credentials are available in both your deployment creation environment and your execution
environment.

Here's an example that uses an `S3Bucket` block from the [prefect-aws library](https://prefecthq.github.io/prefect-aws/):

```python s3_storage_auth.py
from prefect import flow
from prefect_aws.s3 import S3Bucket


if __name__ == "__main__":
    flow.from_source(
        source=S3Bucket.load("my-code-storage"), entrypoint="my_file.py:my_flow"
    ).deploy(name="test-s3", work_pool_name="my-docker-pool")
```

The deployment creation mechanics or `.serve` are similar to `.deploy`. `.deploy`
just requires a work pool name and has a number of parameters dealing with flow code storage for Docker images.

Unlike `.serve`, if you don't specify an image to use for your flow, you must to specify where to pull the flow code from at runtime with the `from_source` method; `from_source` is optional with `.serve`.
