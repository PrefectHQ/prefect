## What is a Flow?

[Flows](/2.11/concepts/flows/) are like functions. They can take inputs, perform work, and return an output. In fact, you can turn any function into a Prefect flow by adding the `@flow` decorator. When a function becomes a flow, its behavior changes, giving it the following advantages:

- It has a [state](/2.11/concepts/states/), which determines when it can run. Transitions between states are recorded, allowing for flow execution to be observed.
- Input arguments types can be validated.
- Retries can be performed on failure.
- Timeouts can be enforced to prevent unintentional, long-running workflows.
- Metadata about [flow runs](#flow-runs), such as run time and final state, is tracked.

## Run Your First flow:

The simplest way get started with Prefect is to import and annotate your Python function with the `@flow` decorator. The script below fetches statistics about the main Prefect repository. Let's turn it into a Prefect flow:

```python hl_lines="2 4"
import httpx
from prefect import flow

@flow
def get_repo_info():
    url = "https://api.github.com/repos/PrefectHQ/prefect"
    response = httpx.get(url)
    response.raise_for_status()
    repo = response.json()
    print("PrefectHQ/prefect repository statistics 🤓:")
    print(f"Stars 🌠 : {repo['stargazers_count']}")
    print(f"Forks 🍴 : {repo['forks_count']}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    get_repo_info()
```

Running this flow from your terminal will result in some interesting output:

<div class="terminal">
```bash
12:47:42.792 | INFO    | prefect.engine - Created flow run 'ludicrous-warthog' for flow 'get-repo-info'
PrefectHQ/prefect repository statistics 🤓:
Stars 🌠 : 12146
Forks 🍴 : 1245
12:47:45.008 | INFO    | Flow run 'ludicrous-warthog' - Finished in state Completed()
```
</div>

## Parameters

As with any Python function, you can pass arguments to a flow. The positional and keyword arguments defined on your flow function are called [parameters](/2.11/concepts/flows/#parameters). Prefect will automatically perform type conversion by using any provided type hints. Let's make the repository a parameter:

```python hl_lines="6 7"
import httpx
from prefect import flow


@flow
def get_repo_info(repo_name: str = "PrefectHQ/prefect"):
    url = f"https://api.github.com/repos/{repo_name}"
    response = httpx.get(url)
    response.raise_for_status()
    repo = response.json()
    print("PrefectHQ/prefect repository statistics 🤓:")
    print(f"Stars 🌠 : {repo['stargazers_count']}")
    print(f"Forks 🍴 : {repo['forks_count']}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    get_repo_info()
```

## Logging

Prefect enables you to log a variety of useful information in the UI about your flow and task runs, capturing information about your workflows for purposes such as monitoring, troubleshooting, and auditing. Let's add some [logging](/2.11/concepts/logs) to our flow:

```python hl_lines="2 11-14"
import httpx
from prefect import flow, get_run_logger


@flow
def get_repo_info(repo_name: str = "PrefectHQ/prefect"):
    url = f"https://api.github.com/repos/{repo_name}"
    response = httpx.get(url)
    response.raise_for_status()
    repo = response.json()
    logger = get_run_logger()
    logger.info("PrefectHQ/prefect repository statistics 🤓:")
    logger.info(f"Stars 🌠 : {repo['stargazers_count']}")
    logger.info(f"Forks 🍴 : {repo['forks_count']}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    get_repo_info()
```

Now the output looks more consistent:

<div class="terminal">
```bash
12:47:42.792 | INFO    | prefect.engine - Created flow run 'ludicrous-warthog' for flow 'get-repo-info'
PrefectHQ/prefect repository statistics 🤓:
12:47:43.016 | INFO    | Flow run 'ludicrous-warthog' - Stars 🌠 : 12146
12:47:43.042 | INFO    | Flow run 'ludicrous-warthog' - Forks 🍴 : 1245
12:47:45.008 | INFO    | Flow run 'ludicrous-warthog' - Finished in state Completed()
```
</div>

Prefect can also capture `print` statements as info logs by specifying `log_prints=True` in your `flow` decorator (e.g. `@flow(log_prints=True)`).

## Retries

So far our script works, but in the future, the GitHub API may be temporarily unavailable or rate limited. [Retries](/2.11/concepts/flows/#flow-settings) help make our script more resilient. Let's add a retry functionality to our example above:
```python hl_lines="5"
import httpx
from prefect import flow, get_run_logger


@flow(retries=3, retry_delay_seconds=5)
def get_repo_info(repo_name: str = "PrefectHQ/prefect"):
    url = f"https://api.github.com/repos/{repo_name}"
    response = httpx.get(url)
    response.raise_for_status()
    repo = response.json()
    logger = get_run_logger()
    logger.info("PrefectHQ/prefect repository statistics 🤓:")
    logger.info(f"Stars 🌠 : {repo['stargazers_count']}")
    logger.info(f"Forks 🍴 : {repo['forks_count']}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    get_repo_info()
```

## [Next: Tasks](/2.11/tutorial/tasks/)

As you have seen, adding a flow decorator converts our Python function to a resilient and observable workflow. In the next section, you'll supercharge our flow by using tasks to break down the workflow's complexity and make it more performant.
