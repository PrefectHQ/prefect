# Team Settings <Badge text="Cloud"/>

Teams in Cloud allow you to share your work among users and to assign [roles](../concepts/roles.html). Each team member will also have their own (free) Cloud Developer account.

## Switching Teams

To switch teams, head to the side-bar and click on your current team. You can see all the teams you are part of as well as any outstanding invitations to join a new team. Click on the team you want to switch to.
