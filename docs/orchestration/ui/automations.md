# Automations <Badge text="Cloud"/>

Automations allow you to configure actions when an event occurs in the Prefect ecosystem.

## Overview

The UI's Automation page provides the ability to create new automations &mdash;  actions such as cancelling a flow run or sending a notification when an event occurs in the Prefect ecosystem &mdash; and editable summaries of all automations created in your Prefect Cloud account.

Automations are only available in Prefect Cloud, and some automation features are limited to Prefect Cloud Standard plan and above.

See the [Automations](/concepts/automations) documentation for details on automation features and configuration.
