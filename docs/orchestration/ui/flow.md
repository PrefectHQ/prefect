## Settings

You can use the settings page to change which project your flow is part of and toggle [flow settings](/orchestration/concepts/flows.html#flow-settings) such as heartbeat, Lazarus process and version locking. You can also use the page to set [Cloud Hooks](/orchestration/concepts/cloud_hooks.html).
