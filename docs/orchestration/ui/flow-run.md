# Flow Run

## Overview

## Schematic

The schematic is an interactive, live-updating look at the progress of each run. As tasks go through different states, their colors and state messages update accordingly.

## Logs

The logs page shows live-updating logs from the flow run. They may be filtered, queried, and downloaded for convenience.

## Restarting

To manually restart a run from any failed tasks, click the "Restart" button in the action bar.

If you want to restart the run from a specific task, visit the corresponding [task run page](/orchestration/ui/taskrun) and click "Restart" on that page.

::: warning Results
The confirmation box notes that if your failed tasks require data from upstream tasks, and you did not specify a result to serialize that data, then your retry will fail. This is because without the upstream data, there's no way for your tasks to run. All Prefect `Storage` classes except `Docker` have default `Result` subclasses; if your flow runs in a Docker container you will need to specify a result subclass when you register your flow for this feature to work.

## Updating State

To manually update a flow run's state, click the "Mark As" button in the action bar. This will bring up a modal allowing you to specify a new state for the run.
