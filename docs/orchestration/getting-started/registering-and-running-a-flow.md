# First Flow

Now that your environment is setup, it's time to deploy your first Flow.

## Creating a Project

Before we can register a flow with the Prefect Backend, we first need to create
a _Project_. Similar to a directory in a filesystem, Prefect organizes flows
into projects, where each flow belongs to exactly one project.

Projects can be created using the UI through either the project filter on the
[dashboard](/orchestration/ui/dashboard) page, or in the [project settings
page](/orchestration/ui/team-settings.md#projects).

Here we'll create a new project called "tutorial".

Alternatively you can use the Prefect CLI:

```
$ prefect create project "tutorial"
```

For more information, see the [projects documentation](/orchestration/concepts/projects.md).

## Register a Flow

In order for your flow to be managed by a Prefect Backend (either Cloud or
Server) it must first be _registered_.

The easiest way to register a created flow is to call `flow.register` with the
name of the project you wish to register it under.

Here's the example flow we'll be using:

```python
import prefect
from prefect import task, Flow

@task
def say_hello():
    logger = prefect.context.get("logger")
    logger.info("Hello, Cloud!")

with Flow("hello-flow") as flow:
    say_hello()

# Register the flow under the "tutorial" project
flow.register(project_name="tutorial")
```

When a flow is registered, the following steps happen:

- The flow is validated to catch common errors
- The flow's source is serialized and stored in the flow's
  [Storage](/orchestration/flow_config/storage.md) on your infrastructure.
  What this entails depends on the type of Storage used. Examples include building a
  [docker image](/orchestration/flow_config/storage.md#docker), saving the code
  to an [S3 bucket](/orchestration/flow_config/storage.md#aws-s3), or
  referencing a [GitHub](/orchestration/flow_config/storage.md#github)
  repository.
- The flow's metadata is packaged up and sent to the Prefect Backend.

Note that the the Prefect Backend only receives the flow metadata (name,
structure, etc...) _and not_ the actual source for the flow. Your flow code
itself remains safe and secure on your infrastructure.

For more information on flow registration, see the [registration
docs](/orchestration/concepts/flows.md#registration).

Running the above should output some details about your flow:

```bash
$ python hello_flow.py
Result check: OK
Flow URL: https://cloud.prefect.io/jim-prefectio/flow/fc5e630d-9154-489d-98d4-ea6ffabb9ca0
 └── ID: 90f9f57b-bff6-4d34-85be-8696d9982306
 └── Project: tutorial
 └── Labels: ['Jims-MBP']
```

After registering your flow, you should see it in the UI on the tutorial
project [dashboard](/orchestration/ui/dashboard.md). Clicking on the flow
will bring you to the [flow](/orchestration/ui/flow.md) page.

Your flow has been successfully registered!

## Start an Agent

You're almost ready to start scheduling flow runs using the Prefect Backend.
The last thing you need to do is start a [Prefect
Agent](/orchestration/agents/overview.md). Agents watch for any scheduled flow
runs and execute them accordingly on your infrastructure.

Prefect has many different kinds of Agents for deploying on different platforms
(Kubernetes, ECS, Docker, etc...). Here we'll start a [Local
Agent](/orchestration/agents/local.md) for deploying flows locally on a single
machine.

In a new terminal session, run the following to start a local agent.

```bash
prefect agent local start
```

This should output some initial logs, then sit idle waiting for scheduled flow
runs. If you need to shutdown the agent at any point, you can stop it with a
`Ctrl-C`. For now, you'll want to leave it running for the rest of the
tutorial.

::: tip Service Account API Key <Badge text="Cloud"/>
If you're using Prefect Cloud, the Local Agent will need access to the Service Account's API Key [you created
earlier](/orchestration/tutorial/overview.html#create-a-service-account-key).

## Execute a Flow Run

You're now ready to execute your first flow run!

Flow runs can be created in a few different ways - here we'll use the UI. On
the [flow page](/orchestration/ui/flow.md) page click "Quick Run" in the
upper-right corner.

This should take you to a new page for the flow run. Here you can track
activity for a specific flow run, view the state of individual tasks, and see
flow run logs as they come in. For more details on the information presented
here, see the [UI docs](/orchestration/ui/flow-run.md).

Eventually the flow run should complete in a `Success` state, with all tasks in
green.

You've now executed your first flow run! In the next section we'll expand this
flow to cover additional features.
