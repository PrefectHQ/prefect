# Overview

This is a Quick Start guide to help you get a basic Prefect flow registered and running on one of our Prefect Cloud or Prefect Core server orchestration layers.  

Because it is a foundational part of running a flow, this guide includes an overview of what is needed to get started with Prefect Core.  If you already have a solid understanding of Prefect Core and want to move on to orchestration, go straight to [using Prefect Cloud or Prefect Core server](/orchestration/getting-started/set-up.md).  

If you want to run a simple flow and have no need (yet) for an API or UI, then check out our [core](/core/getting_started/quick-start.md) docs.  

Once you've gone through the basic tutorial, we encourage you to find out more about Prefect concepts by reading [Thinking Prefectly](/core/about_prefect/thinking-prefectly.md) and looking at our [other resources](/orchestration/getting-started/more-resources.md).
