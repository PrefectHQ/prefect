So far we've been using the default [flow
configuration](/orchestration/flow_config/overview.md). When using a Prefect Backend,
each flow is configured with:

- **Storage**: describes where the flow should be stored to and loaded from
  during execution. By default this uses
  [Local](/orchestration/flow_config/storage.md#local) storage, which stores
  your flow locally as a file on your machine.

- **Run Configuration**: describes where and how a flow run should be executed.
  By default this is a
  [UniversalRun](/orchestration/flow_config/run_configs.md#universalrun), which
  works with any [Agent](/orchestration/agents/overview.html).

- **Executor**: describes where and how *tasks* in a flow run should be
  executed. By default this is a
  [LocalExecutor](/orchestration/flow_config/executors.md#localexecutor), which
  executes tasks serially in a single thread.

To demonstrate these, we'll add two more requirements to our `hello-flow`:

- The greeting used should be provided by an environment variable `GREETING`
- We need to be able to greet lots of people in parallel

## Configure Environment Variables

We'll handle the environment variable requirement first. Environment variables
in a flow run can be configured in several places. Two common locations:

- On the agent, by passing `--env KEY=VALUE` when starting the agent. All
  flows run by the agent will then have that environment variable set.

- On the flow, through the flow's
  [RunConfig](/orchestration/flow_config/run_configs.md). All runs of the flow
  will then have that environment variable set.

Here we'll use a [LocalRun](/orchestration/flow_config/run_configs.md#localrun),
since we're running a local agent.

Our new flow code might look like this:

```python
import os

import prefect
from prefect import task, Flow, Parameter
from prefect.run_configs import LocalRun


@task
def say_hello(name):
    # Load the greeting to use from an environment variable
    greeting = os.environ.get("GREETING")
    logger = prefect.context.get("logger")
    logger.info(f"{greeting}, {name}!")


with Flow("hello-flow") as flow:
    people = Parameter("people", default=["Arthur", "Ford", "Marvin"])
    say_hello.map(people)

# Configure the `GREETING` environment variable for this flow
flow.run_config = LocalRun(env={"GREETING": "Hello"})

# Register the flow under the "tutorial" project
flow.register(project_name="tutorial")
```

Try registering and running the above flow - you should see that the `GREETING`
environment variable is properly forwarded and used.

Changing or configuring a flow's `run_config` is a useful way to customize the
environment in which a flow runs. There are different types for deploying on
different platforms (`KubernetesRun` for kubernetes, `DockerRun` for docker,
...), each with different options. See the [run configuration
docs](/orchestration/flow_config/run_configs.md) for more information.

## Enable Parallel Execution

Sometimes flows can benefit from parallel execution. This is especially useful
when combined with [mapped tasks](/core/concepts/mapping.md), where there are
lots of opportunities for parallelism.

The simplest way to enable parallel execution for a flow is to swap out the
default [LocalExecutor](/orchestration/flow_config/executors.md#localexecutor)
for a
[LocalDaskExecutor](/orchestration/flow_config/executors.md#localdaskexecutor).
This will run your tasks in parallel using a pool of threads (or processes).

Since our `say_hello` task runs far too quickly to benefit from parallel
execution, we'll add a `time.sleep` to provide a better demo.

```python
import os
import time

import prefect
from prefect import task, Flow, Parameter
from prefect.run_configs import LocalRun
from prefect.executors import LocalDaskExecutor


@task
def say_hello(name):
    # Add a sleep to simulate some long-running task
    time.sleep(10)
    # Load the greeting to use from an environment variable
    greeting = os.environ.get("GREETING")
    logger = prefect.context.get("logger")
    logger.info(f"{greeting}, {name}!")


with Flow("hello-flow") as flow:
    people = Parameter("people", default=["Arthur", "Ford", "Marvin"])
    say_hello.map(people)

# Configure the `GREETING` environment variable for this flow
flow.run_config = LocalRun(env={"GREETING": "Hello"})

# Use a `LocalDaskExecutor` to run this flow
# This will run tasks in a thread pool, allowing for parallel execution
flow.executor = LocalDaskExecutor()

# Register the flow under the "tutorial" project
flow.register(project_name="tutorial")
```

Register and run the flow.

You should see multiple `say_hello` tasks running in parallel, providing a
noticeable speedup (this ran in 13 seconds, when serially it would have taken
30 seconds). If you look through the logs you can also see logs from each task
interleaved, showing they ran concurrently.

Not every flow will require or benefit from parallelism, but when needed
swapping out the executor can result in large performance improvements. Prefect
supports several executors not discussed here, for more information see the
[executors documentation](/orchestration/flow_config/executors.md).
