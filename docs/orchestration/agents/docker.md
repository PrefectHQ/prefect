# Docker Agent

The Docker agent is designed to work in all environments with access to a Docker daemon. Docker agents are most commonly used on personal machines for testing flow run deployments, but still serves as a fully functioning method of executing flows in conjunction with the Prefect API.

### Requirements

::: warning Docker Daemon
The Docker Agent requires an accessible Docker daemon. So if you are using this on your local machine make sure that you have Docker running. If Docker is not running, or the agent cannot access a daemon, it will notify users on start.

### Usage

```
$ prefect agent docker start

```

The Docker Agent can be started either through the Prefect CLI or by importing the `DockerAgent` class from the core library.

::: tip Tokens <Badge text="Cloud"/>
There are a few ways in which you can specify a `RUNNER` API token:

- command argument `prefect agent docker start -t MY_TOKEN`
- environment variable `export PREFECT__CLOUD__AGENT__AUTH_TOKEN=MY_TOKEN`
- token will be used from `prefect.config.cloud.auth_token` if not provided from one of the two previous methods

### Process

On start, the Docker Agent verifies that it can connect to a Docker daemon. The default daemon location is determined by your system. `npipe:////./pipe/docker_engine` for Windows and `unix://var/run/docker.sock` for Unix. A separate Docker daemon location can be provided either through `base_url` when instantiating a `DockerAgent` object or through `--base-url` on the CLI.

The Docker Agent periodically polls for new flow runs to execute. When a flow run is retrieved from the Prefect API, the agent confirms that the flow was registered with a Docker storage option and uses the connected Docker daemon to create a container and run the flow.

The agent will block on the process in between finding the flow run and submitting it for execution if it has to pull the flow's Docker image.

::: tip no-pull
The docker agent has an optional `--no-pull` flag where it will not attempt to pull the flow's Docker storage from a registry if desired. This is useful for cases in which a user may be testing the process completely locally without pushing the flow's Docker storage to a registry. Alternatively, if a flow's Docker storage does not have a `registry_url` specified then the Docker Agent will not attempt to pull the image.
