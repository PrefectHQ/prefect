# Dask Cluster on Kubernetes <Badge text="Cloud"/>

This recipe is for a flow deployed to Kubernetes using a static Dask cluster. This Dask cluster lives on the same Kubernetes cluster that the flow runs on.

### Dask YAML

`dask_scheduler.yaml` is the deployment that runs the Dask scheduler.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: dask-scheduler
  labels:
    app: dask-scheduler
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: dask-scheduler
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: dask-scheduler
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: dask-scheduler
          image: prefecthq/prefect:latest
          args:
            - dask-scheduler
            - --port
            - "8786"
          env:
            - name: DASK_DISTRIBUTED__SCHEDULER__WORK_STEALING
              value: "False"
          ports:
            - containerPort: 8786
          resources: {}
```

`dask_worker.yaml` is the deployment that runs the Dask workers. Notice that setting `replicas: 2` means that there will be two workers in this Dask cluster.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: dask-worker
  labels:
    app: dask-worker
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: dask-worker
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: dask-worker
    spec:
      containers:
        - image: prefecthq/prefect:latest
          args:
            [
              dask-worker,
              dask-scheduler:8786,
              --no-bokeh,
              --nthreads,
              "1",
              --nprocs,
              "2",
            ]
          name: dask-worker
          env:
            - name: DASK_DISTRIBUTED__SCHEDULER__BLOCKED_HANDLERS
              value: "['feed', 'run_function']"
            - name: DASK_DISTRIBUTED__SCHEDULER__WORK_STEALING
              value: "False"
          resources: {}
```

`dask_service.yaml` is the service that makes the Dask scheduler accessible over `dask-scheduler:8786`.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: dask-scheduler
spec:
  selector:
    app: dask-scheduler
  ports:
    - port: 8786
      targetPort: 8786
```

:::warning Dependencies
One thing to note in this recipe is the fact that the Dask scheduler and worker pods use the base `prefecthq/prefect:latest` image; this is because our flow has no external dependencies beyond Prefect. When running Dask on Kubernetes you should ensure your image contains the dependencies your flow needs to execute, either by using the flow's Docker storage as the image for Dask or by building a custom image with all the required dependencies.

### Flow Source

`dask_flow.py` is a flow which uses the
[LocalEnvironment](/orchestration/execution/local_environment.html) with a
[DaskExecutor](/api/latest/engine/executors.html#daskexecutor) to execute a
flow on a static Dask cluster. The Dask scheduler address is the one that was
assigned from `dask_service.yaml`.

```python
from prefect import task, Flow
from prefect.engine.executors import DaskExecutor
from prefect.environments import LocalEnvironment
from prefect.environments.storage import Docker


@task
def get_value():
    return "Example!"


@task
def output_value(value):
    print(value)


flow = Flow(
    "Static Dask Cluster Example",
    environment=LocalEnvironment(
        executor=DaskExecutor("tcp://dask-scheduler:8786"),
    ),
    storage=Docker(
        registry_url="gcr.io/dev/", image_name="dask-k8s-flow", image_tag="0.1.0"
    ),
)

# set task dependencies using imperative API
output_value.set_upstream(get_value, flow=flow)
output_value.bind(value=get_value, flow=flow)
```
