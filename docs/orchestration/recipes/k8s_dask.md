# Static Dask Cluster on Kubernetes

<div style="border: 2px solid #27b1ff; border-radius: 10px; padding: 1em;">
Looking for the latest <a href="https://docs.prefect.io/">Prefect 2</a> release? Prefect 2 and <a href="https://app.prefect.cloud">Prefect Cloud 2</a> have been released for General Availability. See <a href="https://docs.prefect.io/">https://docs.prefect.io/</a> for details.

This recipe is for a flow deployed to Kubernetes using a shared static
[Dask](https://dask.org) cluster. This Dask cluster runs on the same Kubernetes
cluster that the flow runs on.

Note that for most deployments we recommend using temporary per-flow clusters,
rather than a single long-running Dask cluster (although there are use cases
for both). See the [Dask
Executor](/orchestration/flow_config/executors#daskexecutor) documentation for
more information.

## Kubernetes Manifests

Below we provide an example [Kubernetes
Manifest](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/manage-deployment/)
for deploying a static Dask cluster on Kubernetes. It starts a cluster with 2
workers, with the scheduler listening at `tcp://dask-scheduler:8786`.

For a production deployment you may be interested in using something like the
[Dask Helm Chart](https://docs.dask.org/en/latest/setup/kubernetes-helm.html#helm-install-dask-for-a-single-user)
instead - the manifests below are only provided as an example.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: dask-scheduler
  labels:
    app: dask-scheduler
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: dask-scheduler
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: dask-scheduler
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: dask-scheduler
          image: prefecthq/prefect:latest
          args:
            - dask-scheduler
            - --port
            - "8786"
          ports:
            - containerPort: 8786
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: dask-scheduler
spec:
  selector:
    app: dask-scheduler
  ports:
    - port: 8786
      targetPort: 8786
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: dask-worker
  labels:
    app: dask-worker
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: dask-worker
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: dask-worker
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: dask-worker
          image: prefecthq/prefect:latest
          args:
            [
              dask-worker,
              dask-scheduler:8786,
              --no-bokeh,
              --nthreads,
              "4"
            ]
```

:::warning Required dependencies
When running Dask on Kubernetes you must ensure your image contains the
dependencies your flow needs to execute, either by using the flow's Docker
storage as the image for Dask or by building a custom image with all the
required dependencies. The manifest above uses the `prefecthq/prefect:latest`
image for both the Dask scheduler & worker pods, since our flow has no external
dependencies beyond Prefect.

## Flow Source

Here we create a flow configured with:

- A [KubernetesRun](/orchestration/flow_config/run_configs.md#kubernetesrun)
  run config, specifying that it should be run by a Kubernetes Agent.
- A [DaskExecutor](/orchestration/flow_config/executors.md#daskexecutor)
  configured to connect to the static Dask cluster created above.
- A [Docker](/orchestration/flow_config/storage.md#docker) storage, specifying
  that the flow source should be built and stored in a new Docker image.

```python
from prefect import task, Flow
from prefect.executors import DaskExecutor
from prefect.run_configs import KubernetesRun
from prefect.storage import Docker


@task
def get_value():
    return "Example!"


@task
def output_value(value):
    print(value)


with Flow("Static Dask Cluster Example") as flow:
    value = get_value()
    output_value(value)

flow.run_config = KubernetesRun()
flow.executor = DaskExecutor("tcp://dask-scheduler:8786")
flow.storage = Docker(registry_url="gcr.io/dev/", image_name="dask-k8s-flow", image_tag="0.1.0")
```
