This is a Quick Start guide to help you get a very basic Prefect flow registered and running on one of our Prefect Cloud or Prefect Server orchestration layers.  

Because it is a foundational part of running a flow, this guide includes an overview of what is needed to get started with Prefect Core.  If you already have a solid understanding of Core and want to move straight onto orchestration, we recommend you skip to [Server or Cloud]().  

If you want to run a simple flow and have no need (yet) for an API or UI, then check out our [core]() docs.  

Once you've gone through the very basic tutorial, we encourage you to find out more about Prefect concepts by reading [Thinking Prefectly]() and continuing to our more advanced [tutorials]().
