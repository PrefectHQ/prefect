# Deployment Quickstart

This guide is designed to show you how to deploy a Prefect flow in as few steps as possible. For a more comprehensive introduction to Prefect's core components and how they work together, please follow our [tutorial](/tutorial/index/).

### Prerequisites

1. Before you start, make sure you have [prefect installed](/getting-started/installation) and are [connected to a Prefect server instance](getting-started/first_steps/#connect-to-prefects-api/). 
2. Optional: Prefect integrates well with version control platforms like GitHub and equivalent. Before you deploy your flow, consider pushing your flow code to a remote repo.

### Step 1: Author a Flow
**The fastest way to get started with Prefect is to add a `@flow` decorator to any python function**.

!!! Tip "Quick Tips"
    - At a minimum, you need to define at least one flow function.
    - Your flows can be segmented by introducing task (`@task`) functions, which can be invoked from within these flows.
    - A task represents a discrete unit of Python code, whereas flows are more akin to parent functions accommodating a broad range of workflow logic.
    - Flows can be called inside of other flows (we call these subflows) but a task **cannot** be run inside of another task or from outside the context of a flow.

Here is an example flow called `Get Repo Info` that contains tasks and a subflow:
```python
# my_flow.py
import httpx
from prefect import flow, task


@task(retries=1)
def get_general_info(repo_owner: str = "PrefectHQ", repo_name: str = "prefect"):
    url = f"https://api.github.com/repos/{repo_owner}/{repo_name}"
    api_response = httpx.get(url)
    api_response.raise_for_status()
    general_info = api_response.json()
    return general_info


@task
def get_n_contributors(general_info: dict):
    contributors_url = general_info["contributors_url"]
    response = httpx.get(contributors_url)
    response.raise_for_status()
    contributors = response.json()
    return {"count": len(contributors)}


@task(retries=4)  # This is a Task that will retry 4 times!
def calculate_average_commits(general_info: dict, n_contributors: int):
    response = httpx.get(general_info["contributors_url"])
    response.raise_for_status()
    commit_data = response.json()
    total_commits = sum(c["contributions"] for c in commit_data)
    average_commits = total_commits / n_contributors["count"]
    return {"avg_commits": average_commits}

@flow(name="Repo Info", log_prints=True)  # This is a Flow called Repo Info
def repo_info(
    repo_owner: str = "PrefectHQ", repo_name: str = "prefect"
):  # Prefect coerces types based on type hints
    """
    A flow that retrieves info on how many stars a github repo has and also calculates the average commits per contributor.
    """
    general_info = get_general_info()
    print(f"Stars ðŸŒ  : {general_info['stargazers_count']}")

    n_contributors = get_n_contributors.submit(
        general_info
    )  # Submit a task to a task runner for concurrent or parallel execution.
    print(
        f"Number of contributors ðŸ‘·: {n_contributors.result()['count']}"
    )  # resolve a prefect future outside of a task using .result()

    average_commits = calculate_average_commits(general_info, n_contributors)
    print(f"Average commits per contributor ðŸ’Œ : {average_commits['avg_commits']:.2f}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    repo_info()  # Call a flow function for a local flow run!
```

### Step 2: Run your Flow locally
Prefect flows don't just look pythonic, they run like python functions too! 

Call any function that you've decorated with a `@flow` decorator to see a local instance of a flow run.

```bash
python my_flow.py
``` 

<div class="terminal">
```bash

Local flow run execution is great for development and testing, but in order to schedule flow runs or trigger them based on events, youâ€™ll need to [deploy](/tutorial/deployments/) your flows.


### Step 3: Deploy the flow

Deploying your flows is, in essence, the act of informing the Prefect API of where, how, and when to run your flows.

!!! warning "Always run `prefect deploy` commands from the **root** level of your repo!"

When you run the `deploy` command, Prefect will automatically detect any flows defined in your repository. Select the one you wish to deploy. Then, follow the ðŸ§™ wizard to name your deployment, add an optional schedule, create a work pool, optionally configure remote flow code storage, and more!

```bash
prefect deploy
```

!!! note "It's recommended to save the configuration for the deployment."
    Saving the configuration for your deployment will result in a `prefect.yaml` file populated with your first deployment. You can use this yaml file to edit and [define multiple deployments](/concepts/deployments-ux/) for this repo.
### Step 4: Start a Worker and Run Deployed Flow

Start a worker to manage local flow execution. Each worker polls its assigned [work pool](/tutorial/deployments/#why-work-pools-and-workers).

In a new terminal, run:
```bash
prefect worker start --pool '<work-pool-name>'
```

Now that your worker is started, you are ready to kick off deployed flow runs from either the UI or by running:

```bash
prefect deployment run '<flow-name>/<deployment-name>'
```

Congrats on your first successfully deployed flow run! ðŸŽ‰
