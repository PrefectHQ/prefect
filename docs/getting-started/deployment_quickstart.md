# Deployment Quickstart

This guide is designed to show you how to deploy a Prefect flow in as few steps as possible. For a more comprehensive introduction to Prefect's core components and how they work together, please follow our [tutorial](/tutorial/index/).

### Prerequisites

1. Before you start, make sure you have [prefect installed](/getting-started/installation) and are [connected to a Prefect server instance](getting-started/first_steps/#connect-to-prefects-api/). 
2. Optional: Prefect integrates well with version control platforms like GitHub and equivalent. Before you deploy your flow, consider pushing your flow code to a remote repo.

### Step 1: Author a Flow
**The fastest way to get started with Prefect is to add a `@flow` decorator to any python function**.

!!! Tip "Quick Tips"
    - At a minimum, you need to define at least one flow function.
    - Your flows can be segmented by introducing task (`@task`) functions, which can be invoked from within these flows.
    - A task represents a discrete unit of Python code, whereas flows are more akin to parent functions accommodating a broad range of workflow logic.
    - Flows can be called inside of other flows (we call these subflows) but a task **cannot** be run inside of another task or from outside the context of a flow.

Here is an example flow called `Get Repo Info` that contains tasks and a subflow:
```python
# my_flow.py
import httpx
from datetime import timedelta
from prefect import flow, task, get_run_logger
from prefect.tasks import task_input_hash


@task(
    cache_key_fn=task_input_hash, cache_expiration=timedelta(hours=1)
)  # Tasks support the ability to cache their return value
def get_url(url: str, params: dict = None):
    response = httpx.get(url, params=params)
    response.raise_for_status()
    return response.json()


@flow 
def get_open_issues(repo_name: str, open_issues_count: int, per_page: int = 10):
    issues = []
    pages = range(1, -(open_issues_count // -per_page) + 1)
    for page in pages:
        issues.append(
            get_url.submit(  # The submit method changes the task execution from sequential to concurrent
                f"https://api.github.com/repos/{repo_name}/issues",
                params={"page": page, "per_page": per_page, "state": "open"},
            )
        )
    return [
        i for p in issues for i in p.result()
    ]  # Use the result method to unpack a prefect future outside of a task


@flow(name="Get Repo Info", retries=3)  # Optionally add retries to flows and tasks
def get_repo_info(
    repo_name: str = "PrefectHQ/prefect",  # Prefect coerces parameter values based on type hints
):
    repo = get_url(f"https://api.github.com/repos/{repo_name}")  # - Task Call -
    issues = get_open_issues(repo_name, repo["open_issues_count"])  # - Subflow Call -
    issues_per_user = len(issues) / len(set([i["user"]["id"] for i in issues]))
    logger = (
        get_run_logger()
    )  # Use logger to add logs or set log_prints to True in flow argument to log stdout
    logger.info(f"PrefectHQ/prefect repository statistics ü§ì:")
    logger.info(f"Stars üå† : {repo['stargazers_count']}")
    logger.info(f"Forks üç¥ : {repo['forks_count']}")
    logger.info(f"Average open issues per user üíå : {issues_per_user:.2f}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    get_repo_info() # Call a flow function for a local flow run!

```

### Step 2: Run your Flow locally
Prefect flows don't just look pythonic, they run like python functions too! 

Call any function that you've decorated with a `@flow` decorator to see a local instance of a flow run.

```bash
python my_flow.py
```

Local flow run execution is great for development and testing, but in order to schedule flow runs or trigger them based on events, you‚Äôll need to [deploy](/tutorial/deployments/) your flows.


### Step 3: Deploy the flow

Deploying your flows is, in essence, the act of informing the Prefect API of where, how, and when to run your flows.

!!! warning "Always run `prefect deploy` commands from the **root** level of your repo!"

When you run the `deploy` command, Prefect will automatically detect any flows defined in your repository. Select the one you wish to deploy. Then, follow the üßô wizard to name your deployment, add an optional schedule, create a work pool, optionally configure remote flow code storage, and more!

```bash
prefect deploy
```

!!! note "It's recommended to save the configuration for the deployment."
    Saving the configuration for your deployment will result in a `prefect.yaml` file populated with your first deployment. You can use this yaml file to edit and [define multiple deployments](/concepts/deployments-ux/) for this repo.
### Step 4: Start a Worker and Run Deployed Flow

Start a worker to manage local flow execution. Each worker polls its assigned [work pool](/tutorial/deployments/#why-work-pools-and-workers).

In a new terminal, run:
```bash
prefect worker start --pool '<work-pool-name>'
```

Now that your worker is started, you are ready to kick off deployed flow runs from either the UI or by running:

```bash
prefect deployment run '<flow-name>/<deployment-name>'
```

Congrats on your first successfully deployed flow run! üéâ
