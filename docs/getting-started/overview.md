# Getting Started

Welcome to Prefect!  

Whether you've been working with Prefect for years or this is your first time, this collection of tutorials will guide you through the process of defining, running, monitoring and eventually automating your first Prefect Orion workflow.  

First and foremost, you'll need [a working version of Prefect Orion installed](installation.md).  From there, you can [follow along with the tutorials](/tutorials/first-steps/) which iteratively build up the various concepts and features that you'll need to get the most out of your workflows.  If you want to take a deeper dive into the concepts that make up the Prefect ecosystem, check out our [Concepts documentation](/concepts/overview).
