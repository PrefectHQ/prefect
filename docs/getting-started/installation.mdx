We recommend installing Prefect using a Python virtual environment manager such as `pipenv`, `conda`, or `virtualenv`/`venv`.

You can use [Prefect Cloud](https://docs.prefect.io/ui/cloud/) as your API server or [host your own Prefect server instance](https://docs.prefect.io/host/) backed by [PostgreSQL](https://docs.prefect.io/concepts/database/#configuring_a_postgresql_database). For development, you can use [SQLite](https://docs.prefect.io/concepts/database/#configuring_a_sqlite_database) 2.24 or newer as your database.

[Prefect Cloud](https://docs.prefect.io/cloud/) is a managed solution that provides strong scaling, performance, and security. Learn more about Prefect Cloud solutions for enterprises [here](https://www.prefect.io/pricing).

**Windows and Linux requirements**

See [Windows installation notes](#windows-installation-notes) and [Linux installation notes](#linux-installation-notes) for details on additional installation requirements and considerations.
</Note>

## Install Prefect

Prefect is published as a Python package. To install the latest stable release or upgrade an existing installation, and upgrade existing Python dependencies, run the following command in your terminal:

```python
pip install -U prefect
```

To install the most recent Prefect 3 pre-release version, run:

```python
pip install -U prefect --pre
```

See available release versions in the [Prefect Release Notes](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect/blob/main/RELEASE-NOTES.md).

See our [Contributing guide](https://docs.prefect.io/contributing/) for instructions on installing Prefect for development and see the [section below](#installing_unreleased_code) to install directly from the `main` branch.

### Check your installation

To confirm that Prefect was installed correctly, run the command `prefect version` in your terminal.

You should see output similar to the following:

```python
Version:             3.0.0
API version:         0.8.4
Python version:      3.12.2
Git commit:          d6bdb075
Built:               Thu, Apr 11, 2024 6:58 PM
OS/Arch:             darwin/arm64
Profile:              local
Server type:         ephemeral
Server:
  Database:          sqlite
  SQLite version:    3.45.2
```

## Windows installation notes

You can install and run Prefect via Windows PowerShell, the Windows Command Prompt, or [`conda`](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/windows.html). After installation, you may need to manually add the Python local packages `Scripts` folder to your `Path` environment variable.

The `Scripts` folder path looks something like this (the username and Python version may be different on your system):

```python
C:\Users\MyUserNameHere\AppData\Local\Packages\PythonSoftwareFoundation.Python.3.11_qbz5n2kfra8p0\LocalCache\local-packages\Python311\Scripts
```

Watch the `pip install` output messages for the `Scripts` folder path on your system.

If you're using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), see [Linux installation notes](#linux-installation-notes).

## Linux installation notes

Linux is a popular operating system for running Prefect. If you are hosting your own Prefect server instance with a SQLite database, note that certain Linux versions of SQLite can be problematic. Compatible versions include Ubuntu 22.04 LTS and Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.

Alternatively, you can [install SQLite on Red Hat Custom Linux (RHEL)](#install-sqlite-on-rhel) or use the `conda` virtual environment manager and configure a compatible SQLite version.

## Using a self-signed SSL certificate

If you're using a self-signed SSL certificate, you need to configure your environment to trust the certificate. You can add the certificate to your system bundle and pointing your tools to use that bundle by configuring the `SSL_CERT_FILE` environment variable.

If the certificate is not part of your system bundle, you can set the `PREFECT_API_TLS_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY` to `True` to disable certificate verification altogether.

**_Note:_** Disabling certificate validation is insecure and only suggested as an option for testing!

## Proxies

Prefect supports communicating via proxies through environment variables. Whether you are using Prefect Cloud or hosting your own Prefect server instance, set `HTTPS_PROXY` and `SSL_CERT_FILE` in your environment, and the underlying network libraries will route Prefect’s requests appropriately.

Alternatively, the Prefect library will connect to the API via any proxies you have listed in the `HTTP_PROXY` or `ALL_PROXY` environment variables.  
You may also use the `NO_PROXY` environment variable to specify which hosts should not be sent through the proxy.

For more information about these environment variables, see the [cURL documentation](https://everything.curl.dev/usingcurl/proxies/env).

## `prefect-client` library

The `prefect-client` library is a minimal installation of Prefect designed for interacting with Prefect Cloud or a remote self-hosted server instance.

`prefect-client` enables a subset of Prefect's capabilities with a smaller installation size, making it ideal for use in lightweight, resource-constrained, or ephemeral environments. It omits all CLI and server components found in the `prefect` library.

Install the latest version with:

```python
pip install -U prefect-client
```

## SQLite

By default, a local Prefect server instance uses SQLite as the backing database. SQLite is not packaged with the Prefect installation. Most systems will already have SQLite installed, because it is typically bundled with Python.

<Info>

If you install the [`prefect-client`](https://pypi.org/project/prefect-client/) library that provides a limited set of the full Prefect library's capabilities, you do not need SQLite installed.
</Info>

### Install SQLite on RHEL

To install an appropriate version of SQLite on Red Hat Custom Linux (RHEL), follow the instructions below:

Expand for instructions Note that some RHEL instances have no C compiler, so you may need to check for and install \`gcc\` first: Download and extract the tarball for SQLite.

```python
wget https://www.sqlite.org/2022/sqlite-autoconf-3390200.tar.gz
tar -xzf sqlite-autoconf-3390200.tar.gz
```

Move to the extracted SQLite directory, then build and install SQLite.

```python
cd sqlite-autoconf-3390200/
./configure
make
make install
```

Add \`LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH\` to your profile.

```python
echo 'export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/usr/local/lib"' >> /etc/profile
```

Restart your shell to register these changes. Now you can install Prefect using \`pip\`.

## Install the unreleased version of Prefect

To install the most up-to-date, unreleased Prefect code, install directly off the `main` GitHub branch: 

```python
pip install -U git+https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect
```
 
Please be aware that this method installs unreleased code and may be unstable.
