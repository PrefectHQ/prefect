### Prefect

We've reimagined data engineering for the data science era. Prefect is a new workflow management system, designed for modern infrastructure. Users organize `Tasks` into `Flows`, and Prefect takes care of the rest.

Read the [docs](/introduction.html); get the [code](/agreement.html); ask us [anything](mailto:help@prefect.io)!


### Hello, world! ðŸ‘‹

```python
from prefect import task, Flow

@task
def say_hello():
    print("Hello, world!")

with Flow('My First Flow') as flow:
    say_hello()

flow.run() # "Hello, world!"
```
