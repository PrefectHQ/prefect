# Contributing Collections

Anyone can create and share a Prefect Collection and we encourage anyone interested in creating a collection to do so!

## Generating a project

To help you get started with your collection, we've created a template that gives the tools you need to create and publish your collection.

Use the [Prefect Collection template](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect-collection-template#quickstart) to get started creating a collection with a bootstrapped project!

## Listing in the Collections Catalog

To list your collection in the Prefect Collections Catalog, submit a PR to the Prefect repository adding a file to the `docs/collections/catalog` directory with details about your collection. Please use `TEMPLATE.yaml` in that folder as a guide.
