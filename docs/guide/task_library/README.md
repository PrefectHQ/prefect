# Task Library

The Prefect task library is constantly growing. This documentation is meant to give a sample of the types of tasks that it includes. However, unlike the API Reference, these documents are updated by hand and therefore may fall behind. For the auto-generated and complete documentation, see the [reference documentation](/api/unreleased) for the `prefect.tasks` module.
