## Contributing

Prefect encourages users to contribute in any way they can!

There are a number of ways you can get started contributing:
- **closing issues**: the [issue board](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect/issues) contains issues with the tag ["good first issue"](https://github.com/PrefectHQ/prefect/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) which should be approachable for first time contributors
- **documentation**: Prefect prioritizes its documentation, as this is usually the first place users go to look for help.  If you find any typos, or want to update something for clarity, users everywhere will thank you!
- **the task library**: Prefect's task library helps users build workflows even quicker by abstracting away common boilerplate.  If you know of a common operation that isn't represented, open a Pull Request to add a new task to the library!

See our [Development Guide](../development/overview.html) for more information on how to get started.
