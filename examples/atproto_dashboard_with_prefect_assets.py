# ---
#
# **Transform social media data into actionable insights with a modern data stack powered by Prefect Assets.**
#
# This example demonstrates how to build a complete social analytics pipeline using:
#
# * **ATProto/Bluesky Integration** â€“ Extract data from decentralized social networks using the ATProto protocol
# * **Prefect Assets** â€“ Use the modern `@materialize` decorator for asset-based data pipeline orchestration
# * **S3 Storage** â€“ Store intermediate data in cloud storage with automatic AWS credential handling
# * **dbt Transformations** â€“ Transform raw social data into analytics-ready models using SQL
# * **Streamlit Dashboard** â€“ Create an interactive web dashboard for data visualization
# * **Simplified Architecture** â€“ No complex resource management or retry logic needed
#
# The result? A production-ready social analytics platform that ingests data from Bluesky, transforms it with dbt, and presents insights through an interactive dashboard.
#
# This example demonstrates these Prefect features:
# * [`@materialize`](https://docs.prefect.io/v3/develop/assets) â€“ asset-based data pipeline orchestration with dependency tracking
# * [**prefect-aws integration**](https://docs.prefect.io/integrations/prefect-aws) â€“ seamless S3 storage for data assets
# * [**prefect-dbt integration**](https://docs.prefect.io/integrations/prefect-dbt) â€“ native dbt execution with enhanced logging
# * Automatic [**dependency resolution**](https://docs.prefect.io/v3/develop/assets#asset-dependencies) for complex data pipelines
# * [**Asset materialization**](https://docs.prefect.io/v3/develop/assets#materializing-assets) with automatic caching and versioning
#
# ### The Scenario: Social Media Analytics Pipeline
# Your team wants to analyze engagement patterns and content trends from Bluesky social networks. You need a pipeline that:
# - Fetches data from ATProto APIs (starter packs, user feeds, posts)
# - Stores raw data reliably in cloud storage
# - Transforms data into analytics models using SQL
# - Presents insights through an interactive dashboard
# - Runs reliably on a schedule with automatic dependency management
#
# ### Our Solution
# Build a modern data pipeline using Prefect Assets that automatically handles dependencies, storage, and transformations. The entire pipeline is defined in Python with declarative asset dependencies.
#
# ### Running the example locally
#
# 1. **Set up environment variables** in `.env`:
# ```bash
# BSKY_LOGIN=your.handle@bsky.social
# BSKY_APP_PASSWORD=your-app-password
# AWS_BUCKET_NAME=your-s3-bucket
# ```
#
# 2. **Configure AWS credentials** in `~/.aws/credentials`:
# ```
# [default]
# aws_access_key_id = YOUR_KEY
# aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET
# ```
#
# 3. **Run the complete pipeline**:
# ```bash
# python atproto_dashboard_with_prefect_assets.py
# ```
#
# 4. **Launch the dashboard**:
# ```bash
# streamlit run dashboard.py
# ```
#
# Watch as Prefect orchestrates the complete social analytics pipeline: fetching data from Bluesky, storing in S3, transforming with dbt, and materializing analytics assets.
#
# ## Code walkthrough
# 1. **ATProto Data Ingestion** â€“ Fetch starter pack members and social feeds using ATProto APIs
# 2. **S3 Asset Storage** â€“ Store raw social data in S3 with automatic AWS integration
# 3. **dbt Transformations** â€“ Transform raw data into analytics models (profiles, activity, engagement)
# 4. **Asset Orchestration** â€“ Automatic dependency resolution and materialization
# 5. **Dashboard Visualization** â€“ Interactive Streamlit dashboard for exploring insights

# ### What Just Happened?
#
# Here's the sequence of events when you run this pipeline:
# 1. **ATProto Data Ingestion** â€“ Prefect Assets fetched member profiles and social feeds from Bluesky using the ATProto protocol
# 2. **Reliable Storage** â€“ Raw social data was automatically stored in S3 with proper partitioning and metadata
# 3. **dbt Transformations** â€“ SQL models transformed raw data into analytics-ready tables (staging, aggregations, rankings)
# 4. **Asset Dependencies** â€“ Prefect automatically resolved dependencies and materialized assets in the correct order
# 5. **Dashboard Preparation** â€“ Final datasets were optimized for visualization and cached for fast dashboard loading
# 6. **Observability** â€“ Every step was logged, timed, and tracked in the Prefect UI with automatic artifact creation
#
# **Prefect Assets transformed a complex multi-step analytics workflow into a declarative, reliable pipeline** â€“ no manual dependency management, no fragile scripts, just clean Python with enterprise-grade orchestration.
#
# ### Why This Matters
#
# Traditional social media analytics often involves fragile scripts, manual data movement, and complex orchestration. Prefect Assets provide **modern data pipeline orchestration with zero operational overhead**:
#
# - **Declarative Dependencies**: Assets automatically resolve execution order based on upstream/downstream relationships
# - **Automatic Caching**: Materialized assets are cached and only re-computed when upstream dependencies change
# - **Cloud Storage Integration**: Native S3 integration with automatic credential handling and data versioning
# - **dbt Integration**: Enhanced dbt execution with proper logging, failure handling, and Prefect event emission
# - **Observability**: Every asset materialization is logged, timed, and searchable with automatic artifact creation
# - **Composability**: Easily extend with additional data sources, transformation steps, or downstream systems
#
# This pattern scales from prototype analytics to production social media monitoring platforms. Whether you're analyzing a small community or enterprise social engagement, Prefect ensures your workflows are reliable, observable, and maintainable.
#
# ### Dashboard Features
#
# The included Streamlit dashboard provides:
# - **Overview Metrics**: Total members, posts, and engagement statistics
# - **Member Listings**: Profiles from the starter pack with follower counts and activity
# - **Recent Posts**: Latest posts with filtering, sorting, and engagement metrics
# - **Analytics Charts**: Engagement trends, top content, and activity patterns
# - **Interactive Exploration**: Drill-down capabilities for detailed analysis
#
# ### Deployment Options
#
# This pipeline can be deployed in multiple ways:
# - **Local Development**: Run directly with DuckDB for rapid iteration
# - **Prefect Cloud**: Deploy with automatic scheduling and monitoring
# - **CI/CD Integration**: Include in automated data quality and testing workflows
# - **Production Scale**: Connect to Snowflake, BigQuery, or other data warehouses
