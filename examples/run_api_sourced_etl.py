# Prefect turns everyday Python into production-grade workflows with **zero boilerplate**.
#
# When you pair Prefect with pandas you get a **versatile ETL toolkit**:
#
# * **Python** supplies a rich ecosystem of connectors and libraries for virtually every data source and destination.
# * **pandas** gives you lightning-fast, expressive transforms that turn raw bits into tidy DataFrames.
# * **Prefect** wraps the whole thing in battle-tested orchestration: automatic [retries](https://www.prefect.io/docs/v3/develop/write-tasks#retries), [scheduling](https://www.prefect.io/docs/v3/deploy/index#workflow-scheduling-and-parametrization), and [observability](https://www.prefect.io/docs/v3/develop/logging#prefect-loggers) , so you don't have to write reams of defensive code.
#
# The result? You spend your time thinking about *what* you want to build, not *how* to keep it alive. Point this trio at any API, database, or file system and it will move the data where you need it while handling the messy details for you.
#
# In this article you will:
# 1. **Extract** JSON from the public [Dev.to REST API](https://dev.to/api).
# 2. **Transform** it into an analytics-friendly pandas `DataFrame`.
# 3. **Load** the result to a CSV – ready for your BI tool of choice.
#
# This example demonstrates these Prefect features:
# * [`@task`](https://www.prefect.io/docs/v3/develop/write-tasks#write-and-run-tasks) – wrap any function in retries & observability.
# * [`log_prints`](https://www.prefect.io/docs/v3/develop/logging#configure-logging) – surface `print()` logs automatically.
# * Automatic [**retries**](https://www.prefect.io/docs/v3/develop/write-tasks#retries) with back-off, no extra code.
#
# ### Rapid analytics from a public API
# Your data team wants engagement metrics from Dev.to articles, daily. You need a quick,
# reliable pipeline that anyone can run locally and later schedule in Prefect Cloud.
#
# ### The Solution
# Write three small Python functions (extract, transform, load), add two decorators, and
# let Prefect handle [retries](https://www.prefect.io/docs/v3/develop/write-tasks#retries), [concurrency](https://www.prefect.io/docs/v3/develop/task-runners#configure-a-task-runner), and [logging](https://www.prefect.io/docs/v3/develop/logging#prefect-loggers). No framework-specific hoops, just
# Python the way you already write it.
#

#
# Watch as Prefect orchestrates the ETL pipeline with automatic retries and logging. The flow fetches multiple pages of articles, transforms them into a structured DataFrame, and saves the results to CSV. This pattern is highly adaptable - use it to build pipelines that move data between any sources and destinations:
# * APIs → Databases (Postgres, MySQL, etc.)
# * APIs → Cloud Storage (S3, GCS, Azure)
# * APIs → Data Warehouses (Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift, etc.)
# * And many more combinations
#
# ## Code walkthrough
# 1. **Imports** – Standard libraries for HTTP + pandas.
# 2. **`fetch_page` task** – Downloads a single page with retries.
# 3. **`to_dataframe` task** – Normalises JSON to a pandas DataFrame.
# 4. **`save_csv` task** – Persists the DataFrame and logs a peek.
# 5. **`etl` flow** – Orchestrates the tasks sequentially for clarity.
# 6. **Execution** – A friendly `if __name__ == "__main__"` with some basic configurations kicks things off.

    # Transform

    # Load
    save_csv(df, output_file)


# ## Run it!
#
# ```bash
# python 01_getting_started/03_run_api_sourced_etl.py
# ```

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Configuration – tweak to taste
    api_base = "https://dev.to/api"
    pages = 3  # Number of pages to fetch
    per_page = 30  # Articles per page (max 30 per API docs)
    output_file = Path("devto_articles.csv")

    etl(api_base=api_base, pages=pages, per_page=per_page, output_file=output_file)

# ## What just happened?
#
# 1. Prefect registered a *flow run* and three *task runs* (`fetch_page`, `to_dataframe`, `save_csv`).
# 2. Each `fetch_page` call downloaded a page and, if it failed, would automatically retry.
# 3. The raw JSON pages were combined into a single pandas DataFrame.
# 4. The CSV was written to disk and a preview printed locally (the flow's `log_prints=True` flag logs messages inside the flow body; prints inside tasks are displayed in the console).
# 5. You can view run details, timings, and logs in the Prefect UI.
#
# ## Key Takeaways
#
# * **Pure Python, powered-up** – Decorators add retries and logging without changing your logic.
# * **Observability first** – Each task run (including every page fetch) is logged and can be viewed in the UI if you have a Prefect Cloud account or a local Prefect server running.
# * **Composable** – Swap `save_csv` for a database loader or S3 upload with one small change.
# * **Reusable** – Import the `etl` flow and run it with different parameters from another flow.
#
# Prefect lets you focus on *data*, not orchestration plumbing – happy ETL-ing! 🎉
