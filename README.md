# Prefect

Prefect is a workflow orchestration framework for building data pipelines in Python.
It's the simplest way to elevate a script into a resilient production workflow.
With Prefect, you can build resilient, dynamic data pipelines that react to the world around them and recover from unexpected changes.

With just a few lines of code, data teams can confidently automate any data process with features such as scheduling, caching, retries, and event-based automations.

Workflow activity is tracked and can be monitored with a self-hosted [Prefect server](https://docs.prefect.io/latest/manage/self-host/?utm_source=oss&utm_medium=oss&utm_campaign=oss_gh_repo&utm_term=none&utm_content=none) instance or managed [Prefect Cloud](https://www.prefect.io/cloud-vs-oss?utm_source=oss&utm_medium=oss&utm_campaign=oss_gh_repo&utm_term=none&utm_content=none) dashboard.

## Getting started

Prefect requires Python 3.9 or later. To [install the latest or upgrade to the latest version of Prefect](https://docs.prefect.io/get-started/install), run the following command:

```bash
pip install -U prefect
```

Then create and run a Python file that uses Prefect `flow` and `task` decorators to orchestrate and observe your workflow - in this case, a simple script that fetches the number of GitHub stars from a repository:

```python
from prefect import flow, task
from typing import list
import httpx


@task(log_prints=True)
def get_stars(repo: str):
    url = f"https://api.github.com/repos/{repo}"
    count = httpx.get(url).json()["stargazers_count"]
    print(f"{repo} has {count} stars!")


@flow(name="GitHub Stars")
def github_stars(repos: list[str]):
    for repo in repos:
        get_stars(repo)


# run the flow!
if __name__=="__main__":
    github_stars(["PrefectHQ/Prefect"])
```

Fire up the Prefect UI to see what happened:

```bash
prefect server start
```

To run your workflow on a schedule, turn it into a deployment and schedule it to run every minute by changing the last line of your script to the following:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    github_stars.serve(name="first-deployment", cron="* * * * *")
```

You now have a server running locally that is looking for scheduled deployments!
Additionally you can run your workflow manually from the UI or CLI. You can even run deployments in response to [events](https://docs.prefect.io/latest/automate/?utm_source=oss&utm_medium=oss&utm_campaign=oss_gh_repo&utm_term=none&utm_content=none).

## Prefect Cloud

Prefect Cloud provides workflow orchestration for the modern data enterprise. By automating over 200 million data tasks monthly, Prefect empowers diverse organizations — from Fortune 50 leaders such as Progressive Insurance to innovative disruptors such as Cash App — to increase engineering productivity, reduce pipeline errors, and cut data workflow compute costs.

## prefect-client

If your use case is geared towards communicating with Prefect Cloud or a remote Prefect server, check out our
[prefect-client](https://pypi.org/project/prefect-client/). It is a lighter-weight option for accessing client-side functionality in the Prefect SDK and is ideal for use in ephemeral execution environments.
