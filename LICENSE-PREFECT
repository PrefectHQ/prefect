6. MISCELLANEOUS
   
   A. Governing law and venue. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed
   in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware applicable to contracts
   to be performed entirely within Delaware. Any action or proceeding to enforce
   or arising out of this Agreement shall be commenced in the state and federal
   courts located in Delaware.  The parties hereto consent to the exclusive
   jurisdiction of such courts, agree that venue will be proper in such courts
   and waive any objections based upon forum non conveniens.  The choice of
   forum set forth in this Section 7 will not be deemed to preclude the
   enforcement of any judgment obtained in such forum or the taking of any
   action under this Agreement to enforce such judgment in any other
   jurisdiction.   
   
   B. Export Control Restrictions. Licensee warrants that its use of the
   Software shall comply with all export control laws of the United States and
   Licensee agrees to indemnify, defend and hold Prefect harmless from any
   liability, claim, loss or expense suffered or incurred by Prefect as a result
   of a breach of this warranty.
   
   C. Assignment. This Agreement shall be binding upon Licensee’s successors and
   permitted assigns; neither this Agreement nor any right or obligation arising
   under it may be assigned, licensed, sublicensed, sold, mortgaged, pledged or
   otherwise disposed of (collectively, a “disposition”) by Licensee without the
   prior written consent of Prefect, and any attempted disposition shall be null
   and void.  Prefect may freely assign its rights under this Agreement to any
   third party.
   
   D. Entire Agreement; Modifications; No Waiver.  This Agreement constitutes
   the entire Agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter
   hereof, supersedes any and all existing agreements relating to the subject
   matter hereof, and may not be modified or amended except by a written
   instrument signed by both parties.  No failure or delay in exercising any
   right, power or remedy under the Agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof,
   nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right under this Agreement
   preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other
   right.  
   
   E. Severability.  If any provision of this Agreement shall be held to be
   illegal, invalid or unenforceable, such illegality, invalidity or
   unenforceability shall apply only to such provision and shall not in any
   manner affect or render illegal, invalid or unenforceable any other provision
   of this Agreement, and this Agreement shall be reformed, construed and
   enforced to the fullest extent as if any such illegal, invalid or
   unenforceable provision were not contained herein.
   
   F. Survival.  The obligations under Sections 3 and 6.B, as well as any other
   provision that by its nature is intended to survive, shall survive the
   termination or expiration of this Agreement.
