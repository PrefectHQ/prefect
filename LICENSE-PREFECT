      of this Agreement to: (a) use the Software; (b) prepare modifications and
      derivative works of the Software; (c) distribute the Software (including
      without limitation in source code or object code form); and (d) reproduce
      copies of the Software (the “License”).  Licensee is not granted the
      right to, and Licensee shall not, exercise the License for an Excluded
      Purpose.  For purposes of this Agreement, “Excluded Purpose” means making
      available any software-as-a-service, platform-as-a-service,
      infrastructure-as-a-service or other similar online service that competes
      with Prefect products or services that provide the Software.

      1.2 Conditions.  In consideration of the License, Licensee’s distribution
      of the Software is subject to the following conditions:

         (a) Licensee must cause any Software modified by Licensee to carry
         prominent notices stating that Licensee modified the Software.

         (b) On each Software copy, Licensee shall reproduce and not remove or
         alter all Prefect or third party copyright or other proprietary
         notices contained in the Software, and Licensee must provide the
         notice below with each copy.  

            “This software is made available by Prefect Technologies, Inc., under the

            THE SOFTWARE, YOU AGREE TO THE TERMS OF SUCH LICENSE AGREEMENT.”

      1.3 Licensee Modifications.  Licensee may add its own copyright notices
      to modifications made by Licensee and may provide additional or different
      license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of
      Licensee’s modifications.  While redistributing the Software or
      modifications thereof, Licensee may choose to offer, for a fee or free of
      charge, support, warranty, indemnity, or other obligations. Licensee, and
      not Prefect, will be responsible for any such obligations.

      1.4	No Sublicensing.  The License does not include the right to
      sublicense the Software, however, each recipient to which Licensee
      provides the Software may exercise the Licenses so long as such recipient
      agrees to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.  

   2. TERM AND TERMINATION.  This Agreement will continue unless and until
   earlier terminated as set forth herein.  If Licensee breaches any of its
   conditions or obligations under this Agreement, this Agreement will
   terminate automatically and the License will terminate automatically and
   permanently.

   3. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.  As between the parties, Prefect will retain all
   right, title, and interest in the Software, and all intellectual property
   rights therein.  Prefect hereby reserves all rights not expressly granted
   to Licensee in this Agreement.  Prefect hereby reserves all rights in its
   trademarks and service marks, and no licenses therein are granted in this
   Agreement.

   4. DISCLAIMER.  PREFECT HEREBY DISCLAIMS ANY AND ALL WARRANTIES AND
   CONDITIONS, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHERWISE, AND SPECIFICALLY
   DISCLAIMS ANY WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
   PURPOSE, WITH RESPECT TO THE SOFTWARE.  

   5. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.  PREFECT WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES OF
   ANY KIND, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, LOST PROFITS OR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL,
   SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, OR DIRECT DAMAGES, HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY
   THEORY OF LIABILITY, ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT.  THE FOREGOING SHALL
   APPLY TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.

   6.GENERAL.

      6.1 Governing Law. This Agreement will be governed by and interpreted in
      accordance with the laws of the state of Delaware, without reference to
      its conflict of laws principles.  If Licensee is located within the United
      States, all disputes arising out of this Agreement are subject to the
      exclusive jurisdiction of courts located in Delaware, USA.  If Licensee is
      located outside of the United States, any dispute, controversy or claim
      arising out of or relating to this Agreement will be referred to and
      finally determined by arbitration in accordance with the JAMS
      International Arbitration Rules.  The tribunal will consist of one
      arbitrator.  The place of arbitration will be Washington, DC. The
      language to be used in the arbitral proceedings will be English.  Judgment
      upon the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court
      having jurisdiction thereof.

      6.2 Assignment.  Licensee is not authorized to assign its rights under
      this Agreement to any third party. Prefect may freely assign its rights
      under this Agreement to any third party.

      6.3 Other.  This Agreement is the entire agreement between the parties
      regarding the subject matter hereof.  No amendment or modification of
      this Agreement will be valid or binding upon the parties unless made in
      writing and signed by the duly authorized representatives of both
      parties.  In the event that any provision, including without limitation
      any condition, of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable, this
      Agreement and all licenses and rights granted hereunder will immediately
      terminate.  Waiver by Prefect of a breach of any provision of this
      Agreement or the failure by Prefect to exercise any right hereunder
      will not be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach of that right
      or as a waiver of any other right.
